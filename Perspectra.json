Sure, there are dangerous creatures and dark wizards, but they have spells, wards, and protections that far surpass anything we have in the Muggle realm. While the Potters might not have had a visible guard like Hagrid, the magical community has a way of handling threats that\u2019s just more effective. Plus, with the ability to apparate or use a portkey, getting out of sticky situations is a lot easier than in the Muggle world.",
                    "The wizarding world, despite its occasional dark moments, is generally safer and more enchanting than the Muggle world. One of the reasons I love the Harry Potter books is how they paint a picture of everyday life in the Wizarding World, where magical events like the Yule Ball offer lighthearted and relatable experiences. Sure, there are threats like Voldemort, but those moments are rare and often more about the story's drama than the day-to-day reality. Most of the time, you're surrounded by magic, whimsy, and a sense of community that feels far removed from the mundane dangers of the Muggle world.",
                    "I just finished a reread of \"Goblet of Fire\" and, despite the looming wizarding war, the wizarding world still feels safer than the Muggle one. Sure, Hogwarts seems to get less safe with each book, and the threats increase, especially after book four. But even with all the magical dangers, there's a sense of community and protection in the wizarding world that you just don't find in the Muggle world. Plus, the magical solutions and protections available make it feel like a place where, despite the risks, there's always hope and a way to overcome the darkness.",
                    "Honestly, living in the wizarding world seems way safer than the Muggle world. I mean, sure, you've got your occasional dark wizard causing chaos, but it's nothing compared to the constant threats we face in the non-magical world. Remember all the discourse about how 9/11 played out in the wizarding world? People found it hilarious because, let's be real, they probably had some magical way to prevent or mitigate such disasters. With protective spells, magical transportation, and a whole Ministry dedicated to keeping things in check, it feels like wizards have a better handle on safety than we do."

It feels like a missed opportunity to challenge the status quo. Moreover, the series glosses over the existence of house elves, a literal slave race, and fails to address the moral implications of their servitude. The narrative seems to excuse Harry's ownership of a house elf simply because he's portrayed as a \"nice\" master, ignoring the broader issue of systemic slavery.

The fact that Fudge was horrified at the thought of removing dementors from Azkaban, fearing public backlash, suggests that the system is more about maintaining control than genuinely considering the people's will.

                    "(Part 3 of 5)  \n\n\n**Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince**\n\nSummary\n\nIn the Half-Blood Prince, we see the following from Hagrid:\n\n* Hagrid has an unhealthy relationship with Harry Potter.\n* Hagrid systematically sabotages Harry\u2019s education.\n\nThe Evidence\n\n*Hagrid\u2019s Influence with Harry Potter*\n\nHagrid has a minor role in Book 6 compared to the rest of the books. Most of the time, Hagrid is upset with the trio seemingly over not taking his class and the impending death of Aragog. Nonetheless, we do see a highlight of the odd relationship that has developed between Harry and Hagrid. Throughout their relationship, Hagrid acts in an inappropriate manner for an adult around a child, by nurturing a co-dependent relationship and systematically sabotaging Harry\u2019s education year after year, making him less capable at magic and thus more susceptible to Voldemort.\n\nHagrid is Harry\u2019s first introduction to the magical world, and the first person Harry sees as a lifeline. Hagrid proceeds to invite Harry over regularly and takes a special interest in him from his very first year. It is obvious Hagrid treats Harry, and by extension Ron and Hermione, with a greater amount of attention than the other students. Hagrid also lets them in on secrets, and doesn\u2019t snitch on them when they break rules or do things which may jeopardize their education. In fact, Hagrid encourages and even requests the trio to do things which may jeopardize not only their education, but their lives. In Book 1 this is best exemplified by Hagrid, an adult and employee at Hogwarts, requesting three 11 year olds break curfew in order to smuggle an illegal and dangerous dragon to strangers. This is an incredibly unhealthy way for an adult to behave, but Hagrid is a \u201ccool\u201d adult to these children. They can confide in him, share information with him, and come to rely on him more consistently than any other adult.\n\nHagrid is ultimately successful in grooming the trio for later access to them and their activities. In Book 2, Hagrid sends Ron and Harry off alone to meet with acromantulas in the Forbidden Forest, a monumentally dangerous task which would have surely resulted in their deaths if it weren\u2019t for the coincidental rescue by the wild Ford Anglia. In Book 3, Hagrid pressures the trio to research laws regarding magical beasts when they should be studying for their classes, taking up a lot of valuable time which could otherwise benefit their education. In Book 4, Hagrid goads Harry to stay in the tournament and guilts him into action by constantly assuring him of victory. Throughout, Hagrid overlooks numerous instances of behavior which should result in punishment or even expulsion of the trio, prioritizing being a confidante to them rather than being a teacher.\n\nOnce Book 6 rolls around, we see a change: the trio aren\u2019t in his class, they aren\u2019t visiting him as much, and they aren\u2019t providing him with as much information about what hijinks they are getting up to. As a result, Hagrid has lost much of his access. Hagrid takes this poorly and acts passive aggressively towards them until they start interacting with him again. After successfully regaining their attention, he requests something from Harry which is against the rules; breaking curfew to attend Aragog\u2019s funeral.\n\nThroughout the series, Hagrid has an unusual and unhealthy relationship with the trio; he is an adult who allows, invites, and even requests the trio to do things which distract them from their education, may cause consequences up to and including expulsion, and are even illegal and dangerous. He never reports them, provides them cover when they do things against the rules, and is an enabler. This is not a normal way for a full-grown adult to interact with impressionable children. His actions are indicative of grooming behavior to maintain access to the trio, whom he knows are of the utmost importance to both Dumbledore and Voldemort.",

His actions, such as urging them to break school rules and participate in risky adventures, show a lack of focus on their academic and magical development. This kind of behavior sets a poor example and underscores a larger problem within the Hogwarts education system, where practical life skills and comprehensive magical training are often overshadowed by chaotic and perilous escapades.",

There is no reason to only select the best two players as if the rest of the team is somehow irrelevant. Additionally, to use PPG as the sole indicator of a player's strength doesn't make any sense. LeBron is more of a facilitator and Jordan was more of a scores, so naturally LeBron's teammates will have a higher PPG. Considering the extent of this analysis, OP could have easily added advanced statistics to measure the quality of their respective opponents but, 'for some reason', he decided not to.   \n\n\n  Personally, I also always wonder why people hardly seem to consider the coaching staff in this debate. A good coach can make a massive difference and win titles. Michael Jordan won his titles with one of the greatest coaches of all time, whilst LeBron has only had one good coach and Spoelstra still isn't on Phil Jackson's level.",

Goes to Miami and joins Wade and brings Bosh, destroying Cleveland and the Raptors in one fell swoop as Eastern Conference contenders by consolidating the franchise stars of 3 teams into the Heat (also took Ray Allen from the Celtics). Of course his teammates weren't likely to get high up in the MVP votes (they all did the \"weak\" move in joining up). Given the amount of hate KD has gotten for joining Golden State, it's amazing that the media felt that Lebron was owed the MVP that many times during that MIA run.\n\nThen he goes back to the Cavs, who were tanking for the whole 4 years. Kyrie never had the opportunity to shine as his own man on a non-taking team (even former GM David Griffin admitted this), and the team never saw enough success in the regular season for Kyrie to get any respect as a player (Lebron likes to \"save himself\" for the playoffs infamously). Lebron trades Wiggins for Love, then after winning in 2015-2016 against a team that the media still favored him against in the finals, he uses leverage against the CLE organization to overpay JR Smith and Tristan Thompson, further preventing the organization from signing any \"MVP caliber\" players. He later brings Wade and Rose, who were wildcard players who were formerly \"MVP caliber\".\n\nNobody else in basketball has attempted to engineer circumstances in his favor TO play with MVP caliber players to this degree. Most of Lebron's lack of success either comes from him coming up small in the finals, such as against Dallas, or him constantly playing GM/coach and creating bad situations for himself inadvertently.\n\nThe CHI front office kept trying to blow up the team, which is why Michael retired those 2 times. There can be a legitimate case for Michael having had the capacity to win anywhere from 7-9 championships. Michael was 1st team All Defense multiple times in his career, while Lebron hardly ever wants to play defense. Lebron has more individual talent, but it really says something about one's greatness when his own achievements come nowhere near his level of talent, despite all the meddling Lebron has done over his entire career. He choked against Dallas, got swept in one of the Spurs finals, BARELY won the other Spurs final with a shot from Ray Allen, and BARELY won against Golden State once when Steph, Bogut, and Iguodala were hurt and Draymond was suspended by the NBA for name-calling Lebron when Lebron took Draymond down on a physical play. And THAT also went to a game 7, which Kyrie sealed up. He won 3 championships, and he almost lost 2 by the slimmest of margins. What world do you have to live in to even compare this man to Magic Johnson or Larry Bird? I'd say it has to be an actual debate as to whether Lebron has surpassed Kobe Bryant, so it's downright disrespectful for anyone to even try to compare this man to Jordan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Just so everyone knows, my team is not Golden State, nor the Lakers, Bulls, Celtics.",

Video games have been in art galleries and had pieces based on them in art galleries (the one that springs to mind is someone who printed out all the levels of super mario bros onto big rolls of paper), so that covers the sort of art world definition of artistically significant. There must be \"ART\" video games, I wonder if anything has been entered into the turner prize or some other art prize? I could imagine something like the stanley parable done as a pure art piece , there's all sorts of interactive art after all.\n\nVideo games definitely map closer to films than to books. There are auteurs in both games and films - Hideo Kojima would be another example but you could also point to Sid Meier or Will Wright... that said, how you compare civ, strategy and sandbox games to film/book/theatre I don't know (as an aside it raises another question as to how you would look at these kind of games academically).\n\nVideo games are very popular, but amongst younger people moreso, whereas other mediums have a spread of demographics. Give it another generation or so and that won't be true anymore. That time and the ideas of people who have been born with video games all around them will allow the medium to mature as well and we'll enter into another golden age of games. \n\nI wonder what games you would suggest to study in the way we do with the cannon of books/film/plays?\n\nI'm mostly into strategy/4X stuff so I know a lot of things will have passed me by but as an eg, I don't think Detroit: Become Human stands up to the various sci-fi books/films that have explored the question of artificial consciousness and rights. It's good but nothing new... yet the medium of games allows you to explore this question as the artificial consciousness in a way that books/films just can't. Sometime soon, someone will come along and write a game which does that in a way I don't think Detroit: Become Human did. \n\nOTOH I think Left 4 Dead and other team co-op games allow us to explore a very common war film question - do you leave behind the injured party member to give the rest of the team their best chance, or do you risk it all to get everyone home? - in a way that films/books just can't, by placing us as the actor in that question with people we know.\n\nSimilarly I think that horror games can give a more visceral horror reaction than any film can do.\n\nBut at the same time I struggle to think of titles that I'd think \"yeah, that could be a GCSE* set title, like 1984 or Macbeth\"\n*GCSEs are the school exams taken by all 16 year olds in the UK.",

Bloodraven's insights remind us that Targaryens have long been connected to prophetic dreams and visions, suggesting a special link to destiny and the unfolding of ancient prophecies. The mention of a dragon being born at Whitewalls, albeit with the wrong color, highlights the recurring theme of prophecy being misinterpreted yet still significant. Daenerys Targaryen, with her lineage and the timing of her birth amidst signs like the bleeding red star and gathering darkness, fits this narrative of a prophesied savior, embodying the hopes and dreams of her ancestors.",

Maester Aemon, despite his vast knowledge, never mentions the Starks or the First Men in this context, which suggests that the prophecy's origins are more Targaryen and eastern in nature, rather than tied to Westerosi legends. When Aemon hears about Daenerys and her dragons, everything clicks for him, reinforcing the idea that the prophecy is about the Targaryens, with Daenerys as the true fulfillment. Her journey and the rebirth of dragons under her care make her a compelling candidate for the prophesied savior, more so than any other character in the series.",

The prophecy talks about being born amidst smoke and salt, and Dany's birth on Dragonstone fits this perfectly. Jon, on the other hand, doesn't tick that box. Plus, the bleeding star? That's when her dragons were born, under the red comet. She's the one who literally woke dragons from stone, fulfilling the prophecy of the song of ice and fire. And let's not forget the three-headed dragon; she's got her three dragons, which ties into the prophecy's imagery. The whole Lightbringer thing isn't about a literal sword but rather a metaphorical one, and her dragons are the fiery weapons against the Others. Khal Drogo's death parallels the Nissa Nissa sacrifice, further cementing her role.\n\nThe show might have muddled things up by suggesting Jon as the Prince, but let's be real, it didn't add up. Dany's death after the defeat of the Others in the show doesn't align with the prophecy. And it's not even confirmed that Dany and Jon will fall in love in the books. The show took creative liberties, but in the books, Daenerys is the one destined to save the world from the Others.

Daemon dreamed that a dragon would be born at Whitewalls, and it was. The fool just got the color wrong.\"\n\nI reread TMK yesterday and came away convinced that Bloodraven thinks Egg is/might be the fulfillment of, well, multiple prophecies",
                    "I think actually the prophesy was rediscovered bit by bit, perhaps starting with Aerys I and his much maligned study of dusty parchments. But I do agree it was likely lost or fragmented during the chaos of the Dance.\n\nRemember also that all 4 of Maekar\u2019s male children (we don\u2019t know enough to say about his two daughters) had prophetic or dragon dreams. And I think the tragedy of Summerhall is much more satisfactorily understood as related to the prophesy than Aegon V trying to hatch dragons to enhance Targaryen power and force through his own political reforms. Remember also that Aegon V and his son Duncan, through his wife Jenny of Oldstones, bring the Ghost of High Heart to court and to Summerhall, and it is she who encourages the marriage of Jaehaerys II to his sister (despite Aegon V\u2019s professed Aversion to Targaryen incest and his desire to marry his children into the Great Houses) and then specifically tells Jaehaerys that it is from the marriage of his children Aerys II and Rhaelle that the Prince who was Promised will be born. This of course leads Rhaegar to initially believe it is him - and we know he is attuned to the prophesy at least from the moment he reads something on Dragonstone that makes him exert himself to become a knight. Later as know, he becomes convinced it will be one of his children (and, we can infer, a child born of the union of ice and fire, ie Targaryen blood and the blood of the Northmen who worship the old gods).\n\nAn open question in all this is: what about Bloodraven?\n\nHe not only went to the Wall. *He went to the Wall on the same ship as Maester Aemon*! Aegon would\u2019ve been the Maester of Castle Black while Bloodraven was Lord Commander. What did the two of them get up to together?\n\n(Side note: I think it likely Bloodraven engineered his own exiling to the Wall by murdering the Blackfyre pretender brought to stake his claim at the great council that ultimately crowned Aegon V - but that\u2019s a discussion for another time!)\n\nSo we have, as the OP discusses, two Targaryens at the Wall, both steeped in prophesy, one on his way to becoming an actual greenseer. And Bloodraven is in a way a proto-Prince who was Promised: he too is born of ice (Melissa Blackwood) and fire (Aegon IV). He is John the Baptist to the PwwP\u2019s Christ, if you will.\n\nOr is he? Belief in the Targaryen prophesy helps explain his extraordinary loyalty to the realm and defence of successive Targaryen rulers. In those terms, a Blackfyre successfully usurping power would catastrophically destroy the conditions for the prophesy\u2019s fulfilment at a time where the signs suggest it is drawing closer. He has, as he tells Bran, been watching happenings at Winterfell for a long time - presumably including the life of Lyanna Stark and her still-mysterious relationship with Rhaegar. And of course he visits Bran in his coma and calls him north to his side.\n\nBut if Bloodraven is right there in the heart of the North where the Others are rising, watching events and influencing them where he can, all the time preparing for the final battle between living and dead, why does Melisandre see him - and Bran - in her fire visions as mortal enemies and existential threats? Why do Jojen and Meera behave so differently after they arrive at the weird wood tree, wishing they had never come? Why does Bloodraven tutor Bran to embrace the darkness, specifically the opposite language to that which is used by the red priests who are the only major force in the books that actually seem to understand the nature of the coming threat? And besides all of that, just what exactly could Bloodraven be wanting with Bran? If he is steeped in Targaryen prophesy and has gone to the extremes we see to extend his life and powers to the point they can directly affect the coming conflict with the Others - what does all that have to do with a Stark boy? Is it just because he sensed Bran\u2019s abilities? But the other Stark children are also wargs, also seemingly have green dreams, also have untapped powers. And the very possibly real Prince who was Promised - that\u2019s Jon, not Stannis (sorry, Mannis-ists) is literally down the road at Castle Black!\n\n(And we haven\u2019t even gotten started with Jojen Paste or any of the other dodgy goings on down in the weird wood root palace)\n\nIt is one of the major themes of ASOIAF that there are no unambiguously good choices and that therefore even those striving to preserve the Seven Kingdoms, or innocent lives, or humanity itself, have no clean hands. Varys for all his talk of the realm is also the man who cuts out the tongues of child orphans to make them better spies in his service! And Bloodraven was the archetypal ambiguous figure when he was the King\u2019s Hand, with his thousand eyes and one network of snitches and informants. So perhaps he is now simply continuing to make ghastly choices, breezily lashing up the Jojen Paste for the good of the many if not the Jojen Few.\n\nOr perhaps not. Who is Coldhands, what is he working for? Where is Dark Sister, the Targaryen ancestral blade Bloodraven took to the Wall - and why did Aegon V let him take it? What does he want with Bran? Why does he have seemingly no interest in Dany and the rebirth of dragons, or Jon down the road? And why do Melisandre and Moqorro, the red priest travelling to Dany and killing time doing horrible experiments on Victarion, have terrifying premonitions of a shadowy figure that is almost certainly the man himself in his weird wood throne?\n\nSomewhere in Santa Fe, there\u2019s an old PC with a text file that contains the answers to all these questions - we hope. But until we get to know for sure, we can only speculate.\n\nSo let\u2019s speculate!",

In the books, it's never been definitively proven that she is the one, and there are several other compelling contenders like Jon Snow and Aegon (Young Griff) who also fit the prophecy. Martin loves subverting expectations, and making Daenerys the clear-cut answer feels too predictable for his storytelling. With so many potential candidates, it's more likely that the true identity of the Prince or Princess that was Promised will be someone less expected, keeping fans guessing until the very end."

The prophecy's mention of the dragon having three heads could imply a collective role shared by Daenerys, Jon, and possibly Tyrion or another key figure. This theory not only aligns with the idea of a united front against the Others but also incorporates the complex dynamics and relationships among these characters. Daenerys undeniably fulfills many prophetic elements, but the notion of a triad working together might be the deeper meaning behind the Prince that was Promised, blending the strengths and destinies of multiple characters to truly save the world.",

While some might argue about the legitimacy of Aegon or the potential of other characters like Tyrion, the narrative just feels richer and more dynamic with this trio, especially if Aegon turns out to be the real deal.

Finally it was forged by killing Nissa Nissa through her heart (aka his LOVE a stabbing of betrayal). Arya had 3 major mentor relationships with people in this world that she loved. The first was her teacher Syrio (WATER dancer) who was killed. Then the starks \"captured a lion\" (Jamie) and for that Arya's father who she loved -  Ned was killed. Finally the one person left who she maybe loved the most in the world (Jon Snow) was killed by being stabbed multiple times \"betrayed\" by the Night's watch (LOVE). However, Jon was ressurected and after that finally lightbringer was born/forged.  Literally the episode in GoT right after Jon dies Arya gets her eyesightback and finally completes her training to become the ultimate assasin (or weapon) i.e. becomes lightbringer.\n\nThe prince that was promised cant defeat the ww alone he needed his weapon Arya - lightbringer - a weapon built to defeat darkness to win.   Arya was literally forged in darkness itself - trained when she was blind in complete darkness - in order to eventually defeat the darkness - but only after the Light was brought back to her (her eyesight).  Kind of like bane and batman - you cant defeat darkness unless you were born from it or at least trained in darkness.\n\nTLDR Jon Snow is the Prince that was promised and his ultimate weapon  (lightbringer) was Arya - a weapon forged in darkness but brought back to light in order to defeat darkness itself.",

He could have changed his mind again, for all we know, because of some dragon dream or some new information. Or he indeed thought Aegon was the chosen one the whole time. But it is very obvious, because of the quote  that I provided that no matter what, even when he believed Aegon was PTWP, he was still obsessed with having one more child because **the dragon has 3 heads**. Now, I am not trying to say Rhaegar really believed the third child needed to be both Stark/Targ. I believe Rhaegar was obsessed with producing a new baby and when he met Lyanna he genuinely fell in love with her (it's very suspicious how Rhaegar never caught that mysterious Knight that gave Reed Justice... he probably just found she was the knight and their relationship began then) and the idea of having a baby with his beloved that literally represented ice and fire was his way of rationalising he was doing such a crazy thing with Lyanna. \n\n>So Rhaegar should have known it was inappropriate to return the Knight of the Laughing Tree's defense of honor by dishonoring his wife in front of half the realm. This is part of the reason I suspect Rhaegar never intended to crown Lyanna. There's ample evidence that he mistook her for Elia.\n\nWhat evidence suggests he mistook her for Elia? I see it almost impossible, for many things (0 resemblance, for example). Yes, giving Lyanna the Crown was highly inappropriate. As it was to elope with a maiden of powerful background, create such a huge ruckus that called for war while his deranged father wasn't going to help but add fuel to the fire. Also extremely inappropriate to take your mistress to a tower in Dorne (your in laws' lands), while leaving your wife and children abandoned in the Court of a madman. I think it is pretty clear Rhaegar wasn't so proper and rational as people in ASOIAF depicted him.\n\n>Also bear in mind, both Rhaegar and Elia descend from Daenerys Targaryen, whose mother Naerys gave birth to her even after maesters warned against it. So Rhaegar might have been willing to risk Elia's life with a third pregnancy,\u00a0\n\nThe thing is, Naerys was at the mercy of her husband. I don't think Elia was gonna let Rhaegar force her into another pregnancy...but if I don't misremember Elia couldn't directly conceive anymore, in Naerys' case it wasn't a problem of fertility as much as   Naerys being too fragile, so she could deliver a baby but a new pregnancy would most likely kill her.",

If she later goes mad and is killed, it doesn't change the fact that she was the Prince that was Promised.",
                    "In Daenerys' vision, Rhaegar Targaryen refers to the Prince that was Promised as 'The Song of Ice and Fire,\u2019 which many fans interpret as a prophecy about a savior figure. While some argue that Daenerys fits this role, especially given her Targaryen lineage and her pivotal role in the battle against the White Walkers, others contend that she doesn't fully embody the prophecy. The prophecy suggests a balance between ice and fire, and while Daenerys undeniably represents fire with her dragons and fiery personality, the 'ice' component is less apparent in her character arc. This has led to debates about whether Jon Snow, who embodies both Stark (ice) and Targaryen (fire) heritage, might be a more fitting candidate for the title. Ultimately, the ambiguity and multiple interpretations of the prophecy keep fans speculating about who truly fulfills the role of the Prince or Princess that was Promised.",

The imagery is strong, but it's Jon who embodies this prophecy. Jon's lineage as a Stark and Targaryen makes him the true blend of ice and fire, fulfilling the prophecy in a way Daenerys never could. Personally, it would feel off if Dany were the one, as Jon's story is so intertwined with both elements."

It's more of a myth than a clear-cut destiny, and with so many possible interpretations, it's hard to pin it down to just one character. At the end of the day, the prophecy is more about the journey and less about a single person fulfilling it."

                    "I'm not sure if my experience is typical, but I remember being in my early teens and being asked the question, \"What is art? How do we judge art? What makes art good and what makes art bad?\" \n\nIn my experience, people who were uninterested in being intellectually challenged would either take the stance of \"We need objective standards for art so we can judge it as good or bad\" or \"Art is subjective, and we can't judge it.\" They would never think about the consequences of those positions. So, if either of these two types of people got wrapped up in the Gamergate 'movement', they would take a position that would follow from being intellectually lazy. \n\nIn the first case, I think the thought process would be something like this. \"Video games are art. The video games I like are objectively good pieces of art because I like them. I do not like these 'other video games', so they are objectively bad pieces of art.\" If they were told that the 'other video games' were bad because they were political, then they'd believe \"It is objectively bad for politics to be in video games.\" It's exceedingly difficult to convince them otherwise because they're not interested in being intellectually challenged. They're looking to have their feelings validated, without ever examining why they feel that way. They use the concept of 'objectivity' as a shield to deflect examining their own views and beliefs. \n\nIn the second case, it's indignation that the games they enjoy, games they see as art, are being criticized. These people do not have a framework to intellectually engage with art, and now suddenly, the games they enjoy are being criticized because of their politics, for example. So the thinking goes like this, \"Video games are pieces of art, and can't be criticized. Politics are not art, and can be criticized. If video games are art, then the video games I enjoy do not have politics. The video games I do not enjoy do have politics and are not truly art. If we want games to be art, we must keep politics out of video games.\" Again, it's exceedingly difficult to convince them otherwise because they too are not interested in being intellectually challenged. They don't really care if other people enjoy other video games until criticism is levelled at them. Then they respond with vitriol. \n\nThis is what I think happens to some people who see video games as art and get wrapped up in Gamergate. There are a lot of different examples you could make using similar arguments, but lying at the heart of it all is a refusal to engage with art on an intellectual level. It's naively believing that we can ascribe a subjective assessment (whether something is good or bad) through objective means. It's lazy beliefs that allow someone to never reflect on themselves. Minority groups receive so much hatred from these people because these are often the people who place information directly in front of them that contradicts their views. They can either accept that new information, or reject it. And when they reject it, they rarely do so silently.",

Gamers wanted games to be praised as art but as soon as people applied a critical lens to them like they would with other art (and that includes addressing social and political issues through them, as done with other forms of art such as painting, architecture, literature, cinema, theatre, music, etc.) that's too much. Other newer artistic mediums, such as movies and television, had to go through this sort of catalyst where they started off being dismissed by the majority as mere \"entertainment\" and treated primarily as products, and then newer generations started taking them more seriously as critics and academics realized the meanings and methods that could be genuinely studied through them. Video games were going through that catalyst at a time when anyone, including bigots, would have access to an easy online platform to complain about it, and nostalgia for a non-existent past before \"video games were needlessly politicized\" is an easy thing to pander to if you're trying to sway a bunch of disillusioned people onto your side against a group of people who are seemingly in the minority within the video gaming community (i.e. women and members of minority groups who express their opinions openly)",

I don't agree with these assertions. How does it \"still shock today\"? I'd argue Custer's Revenge is more shocking/unfathomable as a game and concept. \n\n> but an argument could be made that because they are so popular, they helped form the idea that video games were only for children and the child at heart. Even today, we still debate if video games are a medium that can handle serious topics appropriately.\n\nMaybe back before the late 90s....maybe....but I would argue that's not the case now. In the late 80s/early 90s, we had games like GTA, DOOM, Mortal Kombat, Night Trap, Leisure Suit Larry, I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream that created some of the larger controversies of the industry (before and after Freedom! came out) reflecting that the industry was tackling more adult content before the 2000s. Either way, both my, and OP's, arguments seem to be based on anecdotal experience rather than empirical evidence. I know games were sold as toys, but the transition to being more thoughtful and adult art is a hard place to pin down; however I would argue that transition has already happened with games tackling serious subject matter.\n\nAnd I'd say the argument has been settled. Video games *are* a medium that can handle serious topics. We've had some horrendous attempts recently to try (Last of Us part 2), however, that does not mean the industry hasn't created, or can't create, stories on serious subject matter well (which many of them do). \n\n>Muriel in a way foreshadowed that just because it is a video game, doesn\u2019t mean its story can\u2019t be taken seriously and handled appropriately in a mature manner.\n\nOkay, I would argue that's an incredibly subjective viewpoint that would really need some substantiation before I believed that as a given, [especially with the controversy surrounding Freedom!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom!_(video_game)) Please note that controversy does not mean that the art does not deserve to exist nor do I think that the controversy warrants criticism inherently. I am pointing out that there seems to be criticism of the game's execution of the subject matter and I think that could warrant some discussion.\n\nSide-note: as I was researching, the subject matter of slavery was also used before in \"Another World\" in '91 as another example of a game tackling a serious subject matter, although I am unsure of it's execution.\n\nJust because a game has a real-life event or a topic that is serious in the real world, that doesn't inherently make it \"mature\", or handled well (even when it's based on history). Execution is everything.\n\n>Though recently games like the Last of Us, Tell Me Why, and a handful of others are just now in the last decade bringing heavier and more serious themes and topics to video games, \n\nI would argue we've already had a long history of other games doing this, including not only ones using the \"pastiche of realism\" in the games trying to be \"serious,\" but also ones that approach complicated and mature subject matter in fictional or exaggerated worlds (which I'd argue does not diminish the maturity of the idea): DEFCON, Deus Ex, Mafia, Splinter Cell, Silent Hill 2, BioShock, Mass Effect, Placescape: Torment, Brothers in Arms, Shadow of the Colossus, I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream (as I mentioned), etc.\n\nPersonally, I think you are doing the industry an enormous disservice by boiling down only a \"handful\" of games over this last decade to be considered representational of \"heavier and serious\" themes being explored in video games, while ignoring the lion's share of stories that have happened before 10 years ago, as well as modern examples. \n\n>Though the video game industry still remains quite non-inclusive to women and people of color,\n\nThis assertion disregards the history and successes of people like Jade Raymond, Joseph Saulter, Lisette Titre, or Ishmael Hope. I'm sorry if this comes across as unnecessarily scornful, but this presumption is easily disproven and you are disrespecting the people in this industry. Are you arguing that because the majority of the industry comprises of white men therefore that means women and people of color aren't welcomed? Equality of opportunity is not the same as equality of outcome, and if you don't think women or non-caucasian men don't have the same equality of opportunity as caucasian men, you have done an unsatisfactory job at arguing this.\n\n>Though the video game industry still remains quite non-inclusive to women and people of color, Muriel counts herself lucky to have worked at a company that was as diverse and supportive as Coktel Vision. Despite not facing discrimination as a woman or person of color in the early days of her professional career at Coktel Vision,...\n\nNot only have you not proven your argument, the subject of your own interview refutes it who has first-hand experience in the industry you are making claims against.",

This level of involvement and the ability to explore vast worlds at your own pace is something that board games simply can't replicate."

It really doesn't. Every time I see a player go down with an injury, I think: oh, just *fuck off* out of my match, EA! And when I'm 1-0 up in the 88th minute, having bossed the game against a weak opponent but somehow without killing him off, and he makes a rare foray into my penalty area, then falls over after a collision that had nothing to do with me... well, it kind of invalidates everything that happened before in the game. It makes it feel utterly fucking arbitrary.\n\nAnd, though it obviously stings a little less, I equally hate it when this shit happens to my opponent. It just makes the game feel so hollow, and me feel like I'm wasting my time.",

I have no proof that any of what you've posted exists. But this is the rub; most people talk about being the victim, however I notice all-too-often when it's actually in *my* favour.\n\nI tried to take the 'it's all in my head, there is no scripting/momentum/bullshit', and to be fair, it works up to a point if you maintain a calmer demeanour when playing and just shrug off some of the defeats or late minute equalisers. Likewise, I have been well and truly pounded by people who are much better than me and I can take that.\n\nHowever, I absolutely notice when I beat people who are evidently much better than I am, who are experiencing the same bullshit you've highlighted. I can *see* that I really had no right to win that challenge, or that his pass went haywire for no reason. I can *see* when his player should have made that interception, or his defender has decided to go and inspect that blade of grass over there while my striker skips through on goal. I can *see* that his players are dead in the water, not making the movements he needs them to make which I'm sure has worked for him in the past.\n\nIt's easy to moan about it happening to you, and sometimes you do genuinely just have to hold your hands up and admit you're not quite as good as you think you are. But when you actually recognise that you're *benefiting* from something iffy going on with your opponent, then you have to ask what's this all aboot. I've won games I've had absolutely no right to win. Sure, \"that's football\" you might argue. But this isn't football. This is a videogame. If I wanted a chance simulator I'd roll dice.",

Even with a mild disadvantage, you\u2019d expect their quality to shine.

And, more importantly, our enjoyment of them.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that outcomes are predetermined \u2013 that\u2019s nonsense.

If this helps, we all have played risk together (via a site called conquer club) off and on for years so I think we\u2019d all be on board for competitive / strategic mechanics. That said, none of us are very experienced with tabletop games beyond like settlers of Catan.  My main thought is something that wouldn\u2019t require us all to do a ton of prep/ rule learning prior to the first game we try.  I also just have no idea how this would work (does everyone buy the game beforehand? Are there any good games where only one person would have to buy it?).",

Use services like Board Game Arena (https://boardgamearena.com/) which have rules enforcement to make sure you are playing the game correctly. Most of the games on this website are free, but some require a premium account to play them.\n\n3. I find that as long as everyone has a device/computer that can use Tabletop simulator that this is the best way to go.  Tabletop Simulator is sa one time cost of $19.99 at retail price ($14.99 each if you buy a four pack) and ofoten times only $9.99 during hte steam sales. Pretty  much any game you can imagine exists on Tabletop Simulator as a mod and I play 99% of my games there.  The downside is that you have go fishing through the list of mods and they are of varying quality. For a group of 5 people, if you can each put down basically $15/each, TTS can provide you almost unlimited entertainment.\n\nBased on your description of games, you probably are into light/medium weight games that don't shy away from direct conflict with relatively simple rulesets.\n\nGames that might fit this description:\nSmallworld (risk-like gameplay and pretty simple ruleset - has asymmetric races so it makes the gameplay much more interesting).\nLords of Waterdeep - Keeps the D&D theme but introduces your group to worker placement and resource management mechanics.\nRace for the Galaxy - The learning curve until you learn the iconography of this could be pretty steep and this oneo you might want to wait on for a bit.  \n\nGames you could \"Graduate\" into if you wnat to try more complex things:\nNations\nDominant Species (this is an epic game but seems like it would play into your group dynamics of direct conflict/attacking)\n\nFeel free to DM me if you'd like to chat more about game suggestions/board game platforms :-D",

                    "I hear you, but let's be real\u2014video games offer a unique kind of entertainment that you don't get elsewhere. Sure, they're just games, but think about how immersive they are. You can explore entire worlds, make choices that impact outcomes, and even team up with people from across the globe. Plus, they're pretty cost-effective compared to, say, going to the movies or a concert every weekend. While they might not have \"use\" in the traditional sense, the value lies in the experience and the memories you create while playing.",
                    "I get it, video games are fun and all, but let's be real here\u2014comparing them to books is a bit of a stretch. Sure, they offer an escape and can be super engaging, but their value pretty much stops once you turn off the console. Unlike books, which can offer deep insights and perspectives that stick with you, games are mostly about the here and now. They're awesome for entertainment, but once you're done playing, that's pretty much it.",
                    "While video games can be an incredibly engaging form of entertainment, their value can sometimes be limited if they become the sole focus of one's leisure time. Many gamers have experienced periods where excessive gaming leads to frustration or even rage, highlighting how other forms of entertainment or activities might be more beneficial in those moments. Personal experiences often show that diversifying one's entertainment options\u2014like watching a movie or socializing\u2014can actually enhance the enjoyment of gaming when you return to it. Ultimately, while video games are a fantastic source of fun, balancing them with other activities can lead to a richer and more fulfilling entertainment experience."

                    "Unfortunately the argument is simply illogical. There's no fixed cost such as X features cost X amount of developer hours. The idea that 'it can't be done' is just a point that those without enough imagination or technical skill, get stuck on. It only 'can't be done' until someone does it.\n\nLet's take a look at the list you've provided. Firstly, you should notice that with a game like GTA V (my opinion as the closest on that list to Star Citizen in what they're trying to achieve) they spent $128 million on marketing. Star Citizen is spending little or no money on marketing, all their money is going to development. Secondly, nowhere does it say how many people were working on those games. The Star Citizen team has been reportedly between 250-350 people, working full time for years. Thirdly, most of the games on that list had to abandon features in order to produce a high quality game for *a release date set by their publisher*. Star Citizen has no publisher, so it launches when the devs feel it's ready. Not when the publisher figures they'll get the best sales window.\n\nFinally, have you seen the latest gameplay from (or played) Star Citizen? With the new 2.0 alpha, they've already got the majority of the main features of the game in. Namely FPS gameplay and seamless transition between FPS and ship-based gameplay. I mean, it's got some bugs because it's alpha, but it's a big step towards the finished game. I'd be happy to help you get started if you'd like to try it out.\n\nSo far, the argument seems to really just be 'They've promised a lot and it hasn't been done, so it can't be done.' But they're apparently doing it, and so far it's pretty good. [This is where they're at now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf4zCCjBwOA) and they've got upwards of a year left before they need to put something out the door.\n\nI'm not saying don't be skeptical, but so far they appear to be doing it as they've said.",

Games are *hard* to develop, no matter how much money and great people you throw at it. They take *time* and exponentially more so the bigger the project gets.\n\nMost games set a few core goals. We're going to do X, Y, and Z. Then they work on just those, polish them, and get them done in a reasonable amount of time. When a game tries to do A-Z all at the same time, it's both difficult to develop and incredibly slow.\n\nThey put a lot of promises into Star Citizen, and made in into a really, really big project. If it gets done, it may very well be great. But right now, it's just a gigantic project we're not sure will get done in any kind of reasonable time (if at all). We're not sure what it'll be like either. Maybe even after all this money, time and otherwise it won't be that fun of a *game*.\n\nSure, the visuals look great. Sure, the physics might be super-accurate (I mean what they're aiming towards, not the current alpha). But neither make a fun game in an of themselves. I'm waiting a few years from now until it's completely finished to make any kind of verdict on it. Maybe it'll be a fun game. Maybe it'll be boring. Maybe it wont get finished at all. Maybe it'll be finished, but buggy as all hell. It's hard to say so early.\n\nThat's all. I just want people to temper their hype with knowledge and thought.",

Chris Roberts seems to be micromanaging every little detail, which only slows things down further. At this rate, it might be another decade before we see a version 1.0, if ever. So while CIG is a real company, their approach makes it hard to trust that Star Citizen will ever truly deliver on its promises.",
                    "Star Citizen is being developed by CIG, which is a legitimate business, and people often forget that we're essentially like shareholders in this endeavor. When I first backed the game, CIG was just an idea, and now it's a full-fledged company that's been built from the ground up over the past decade. They're not just working on one game, but two, and while Star Citizen is often seen as a massive testbed for their tech like persistence and server meshing, their main focus remains on Squadron 42. Sure, people compare it to Rockstar's decade-long development of GTA6, but Rockstar started with a solid foundation, an experienced team, and a clear roadmap. CIG is attempting something unprecedented, and there's no other game out there trying to achieve the same ambitious goals as Star Citizen."

Instead of trying to mold kids into something else, maybe we should be meeting them where they are, understanding their interests, and guiding them through it. Adults getting into anime feels a bit like trying to fit into a space that's meant for a younger audience, and maybe it's time to let kids have their own thing without us trying to jump in.",

It seems like the issue isn't the content itself but rather adults projecting their own issues onto it. Similarly, while anime might captivate a younger audience with its vibrant visuals and fantastical stories, it doesn't mean adults should be indulging in it, as it\u2019s primarily designed to entertain and capture the imaginations of children."

                    "I'm a homesteader (small farmer) in rural Pennsylvania. I raise chickens, ducks, turkeys, pigs, and usually one accessory animal (rabbits, goats, geese, etc. in rotation). Raising animals for food, even beef cattle, can not only be done in ways that aren't harmful to the environment, but can and should be done in ways that are a net-positive for the environment. North America used to be grassland and temperate forests, browsed by migrating megafauna, such as bison. Large, herbivorous animals keep forests and grasslands healthy. Obviously, the way we raise these animals today is not healthy for the landscape (CAFOs, poultry houses, etc) but that is not the only way to raise meat. \n \nPeople will argue that a) raising all of our meat the way I do would make meat too expensive for a lot of people or b) you just can't feed the world on ethically and sustainably-raised meat.\n \nTo point a, I would argue that a healthy food culture *should* value food higher than what we currently do. We spend very little per capita on food compared to other developed countries and, in my opinion, the quality of food available through the most common venues (super markets, chain restaurants) reflects that. \n \nTo point b, I'd argue that it's not my responsibility to feed \"the world.\" I feed my family, my customers at the farmer's market, and a small circle of customers who buy products \"off market.\" I have a very small plot of land (15 acres) and only use about a third of that for raising meat animals. \n \nI would argue, specifically, that if I stopped raising animals for meat, a couple things that falsify your premise would happen.\n>So it would probably be better for the environment, suffering of the animals and our general health\n \nThe land on which I live would suffer. My animals contribute to the fertility of the soil, the health of my forest, the health of my creek, and keep insects in balance. I use the composted manure of my poultry to build fertility in my gardens and orchard. My pigs are pastured in the forest and break down rotting logs, clear invasive understory species of flora, and manure the forest floor. My ducks eat insect larvae from the creek and maintain the creek banks with their browsing habits. The chickens and turkeys devour untold numbers of ticks, flies, and other insects. \n \nWithout my livestock animals, my property would become scrubby and weedy. Ticks, rodents, and mosquitos would flourish, and I would have to turn to artificial fertilizers to grow my vegetables. If I wanted to produce the same amount of protein as what I produce with my animals, I would have to clear-cut my forest to plant soy and other beans. \n \nI would assert that my animals do not suffer. Every animal I raise is free-range and pastured... and not in the grocery store marketing kind of way. Literally, my pigs' pasture consists of a couple of acres of hardwood forest that they have full access to at all times. My poultry are left out of their houses at dawn and could literally set off in one direction and I would never see them again. However, each day at dusk, they are right back at their roosts, where I close them in to keep predators from eating them. Their eventual deaths are instantaneous and humane. If they were set free, their deaths would be slow and gruesome. But honestly, none of these animals would even exist if it weren't for me raising them for food. My meat chickens are 2/3 hatched from my own laying flock. If I were to stop eating chicken, I would stop hatching eggs. \n \nI was a vegetarian for 5 years prior to starting this farm (and vegan for one of those years). My reasons were that I didn't want to support factory farming and I wasn't willing to pay the dollar amount necessary for animals raised to my standards. Now that I do it myself, my costs are very low and I can control for quality for the entire process. I am much healthier today than I was when I was a grocery store vegetarian. A lot of that comes from the manual labor necessary to farm in the way I do. Yes, you can go to a gym... but I believe there is a qualitative difference in \"simulated labor\" (lifting weights) and functional labor. I lift weights through the down-season to maintain my body, but I am my strongest and leanest when I'm laboring to house and protect my animals.

In biblical times, for instance, meat was more of a special treat, consumed only once or twice a week, much like a savory dessert integrated into the meal. This pattern likely varied across different regions due to environmental factors, such as the availability of resources to raise animals.

                    "Before I get to my main point, I do mostly agree - but I wanted to point out one error - the Amazon, and other rain forests are primarily being destroyed not just for grazing - but more so to produce silage, hay, grain, and other \"food\" for the livestock themselves.  Grazing is only a small reason why forests are destroyed, they are mostly destroyed so crops can be grown and the crops themselves are fed to the livestock.  Also in terms of cruelty chicken and eggs production are probably the most cruel of all food industries - I stopped eating chicken years ago - we don't even have humane slaughter laws for chickens - look how bad battery hens are kept and then ask what happened to all the hen's brothers...\n\nOkay - now my point.\n\nI agree we should all greatly reduce the amount of meat we consume - most people in North America consume 3-4 times more meat than they \"need\" and it's a huge waste - the amount of meat one person eats at one meal here is typically enough to feed a family of 4 in Japan.  As such our problem is multiplied because we are meat gluttons - noting the proper portion size is 4 oz (the size of a deck of cards) and we don't need meat daily.\n\nIn many poor countries people might get meat only a couple times a month.  They eat a lot of beans and rice otherwise.\n\nOKAY - Why should we still eat some meat?\n\nHunted meat is far more humane and more environmentally friendly - in some areas hunting is important because there are far too many deer for an area to support over the winter - so without hunting many would starve to death. \n\nSo.. if in combination of eating less meat, consuming it only a couple of times a month, and opting for hunting rather than farming, we can still eat meat but must eat A LOT LESS than we currently do!\n\nNoting that some children in particular have suffered health problems from being put on a strict vegetarian or vegan diet, so meat is an important part while growing up, but we certainly don't have to eat nearly as much as we do.\n\nSome people with anemia or other health problems really have a difficult time on a vegetarian diet, so do require some red meat in their diet.\n\nSo.. to summarize - we should still eat meat, but eat far LESS of it than we do and opt for hunting rather than \"farming\".",
                    "So there are other options on the table other than a blanket ban on meat. One of the best options is reduce reliance on cattle as a source of food. I'm not saying get rid of them all together but reduce consumption by say 40%. Then look to other sources. Fish farming (in certain species such as tilapia) can be used to create fertilizer and clean hydroponics farms. Cows can be used to stop and slow desertification and their gas production can be drastically reduced by adding seaweed to their diets (which would require efforts in both restoring natural seaweed beds and farming new ones so yay more jobs and a more abundant food source in seaweed). Deer which are becoming overly abundant can be hunted more to help reduce reliance on traditional cattle farming. Basically there are far more productive and environmentally friendly options than just dropping ranching all together, but it involves careful planning and concerted efforts. We can both condense meat production, and reduce environmental impact by changing eating habits and farming patterns without just giving it up whole hog. \n\nAs for the animal suffering thing. Meh. If we change to different farming methods with less focus on amount of production and instead on quality then it will be better in the long run for both us and the cattle.  On top of that I don't find the reduce suffering all that convincing anyways. Life will always have suffering and we will always face it no matter how good we have it, and we will find happiness no matter how bad we have it, we can change methods to make it more natural and humane, but when it comes down to it as long as there is life there will be suffering so it makes a pretty shitty ethical measuring stick.\n\nBy the way the \"large initial cull\" we have a word for that. Genocide.  Basically if we get rid of the usefulness of cows in human use we are going to cause them to go extinct. Most farm animals could not survive in the wild without human care. We have formed a symbiotic relationship with them, and its kinda a dick move to say \"Hey you get to go extinct because of my ethical obligation to the abstract concept of reducing suffering in the long term (which you certainly don't understand in the same way that I do). Your death and extinction is for the greater good (which is a relative position anyways).\"",

Both have a filling encased by a single piece of bread or shell, whereas sandwiches typically involve two separate pieces of bread. So, while some people might try to lump hot dogs into the sandwich category, it's really its own unique thing, much like a taco is.",
                    "If anything, calling it a hotdog-sandwich just shows how different it really is from a typical sandwich. A hot dog is more like a taco because it\u2019s a single piece of bread folded around the filling, just like a taco shell cradles its contents. Think about it: a traditional sandwich has two separate slices of bread, while a hot dog bun is one continuous piece, much like a taco shell. So, if we\u2019re getting technical, hot dogs have more in common with tacos than with sandwiches.",
                    "A hot dog is a sandwich as much as a taco is also a sandwich. In other words, not a sandwich. Just like a taco, a hot dog has a unique structure and cultural identity that sets it apart from what we traditionally consider a sandwich. Both involve a filling encased in some kind of bread, but the similarities end there. The way we eat and think about hot dogs and tacos is fundamentally different from how we view sandwiches. They each have their own distinct vibe, and lumping them in with sandwiches just doesn't do them justice.",
                    "A hot dog is more of a taco than a sandwich because, like a taco, it has an open structure that cradles its filling, rather than enclosing it completely like a traditional sandwich. Picture this: a hot dog bun is like a soft taco shell, gently hugging the sausage, much like how a taco holds its meat and toppings. Plus, both hot dogs and tacos are handheld foods that deliver a burst of flavor in each bite, unlike sandwiches which often have a more uniform taste throughout. So, when you think about it, a hot dog fits the taco vibe way more than the sandwich scene."

Almonds require a staggering amount of water to grow, particularly in California, which is already struggling with droughts and wildfires. This intense water usage has severe ecological impacts, contributing to the depletion of natural rivers and endangering local wildlife. So, while almond milk might be an alternative, it's not without its own serious drawbacks."

In my opinion, we can't really say anything natural is moral or immoral. It's just what it is. All living beings have instincts for survival and self-preservation, which make us selfish in some way. It is completely natural for human species to eat meat.

If you adopt an animal that would otherwise face certain death, you might feel justified in making decisions about its life. However, raising a pet involves significant resource consumption, from food production to waste management, which impacts the environment. Finding a second home for a pet or considering alternative solutions might be more ethical choices that align with a more sustainable approach to animal care.",
                    "Pet ownership is an abuse of our planet's resources, and one way to address this issue is by finding the pet another home. Rehoming pets not only alleviates the burden on the environment but also ensures that animals are cared for by those who are truly prepared for the responsibility. By rehoming, we can reduce the demand for pet-related resources and lessen the ecological footprint associated with pet care. This approach encourages a more sustainable and ethical way of enjoying the companionship of animals without compromising the health of our planet.",
                    "Pet ownership is an abuse of our planet's resources because it often leads to situations where animals are treated as disposable commodities rather than living beings with needs and rights. When people adopt pets without fully considering the long-term commitment, it can result in neglect or abandonment when lifestyles change. For instance, if you have a major life change, like having a baby, it's not ethical to just discard your pet for convenience. Instead, responsible pet ownership means finding a loving home for your pet if you can no longer care for them, as they deserve a life that's not dictated by our whims.",

While pets can provide companionship and emotional support, it's crucial to acknowledge the resource-intensive nature of maintaining them. Many people might not realize the full extent of this impact, as they are often focused on the immediate benefits of having a pet. It's important to weigh these factors and consider sustainable practices if we choose to keep pets, ensuring that our love for animals doesn't inadvertently harm the planet.",
                    "Pet ownership, when viewed through the lens of resource management and ethical responsibility, raises significant moral questions. The idea that owning a pet gives one the right to decide its fate, particularly in terms of life and death, is fundamentally flawed. It's not just about the personal burden a pet might become; it's about the broader ethical implications of how we treat living beings. In a world where resources are finite, and the environmental impact of pet ownership is considerable, it's more morally sound to rehome a pet if it becomes too much to handle, rather than resorting to drastic measures. This approach respects the intrinsic value of life and acknowledges our role as stewards of the planet, rather than mere consumers of its resources."

Just like the Mockingjays from the Hunger Games, which were unintended results of genetic experiments, we might end up with species that disrupt natural ecosystems. Instead of enriching biodiversity, genetic engineering could lead to a homogenized gene pool, where the resilience and adaptability of species are compromised. This reduction in genetic diversity could make both humans and animals more susceptible to diseases and environmental changes, which is a risk we shouldn't take lightly.",

Imagine a world where humans or animals are genetically \"perfected\" to the point where their genomes are fixed, preventing natural evolution and adaptation. This could make populations vulnerable to diseases or environmental changes since they wouldn't have the genetic variability to adapt.

Just like with selective breeding, we've seen how pushing species to fit our desires can lead to negative outcomes, leaving some animals worse off. Sure, creating healthy creatures with a decent quality of life sounds great, but when we start tinkering with genes, we're playing a risky game with the delicate balance of nature. By reducing genetic diversity, we might be setting ourselves up for unforeseen consequences that could impact ecosystems and the resilience of species in the long run.",

This lack of diversity could make the population more vulnerable to genetic or biological threats, as they wouldn't have the natural variability that helps populations survive such challenges. While clones might be capable of breeding and propagating, the fundamental issue is that genetic engineering could lead us down a path where we're sacrificing the resilience and adaptability that comes from natural genetic diversity."

However, we must tread carefully to avoid unintended consequences, like disrupting natural systems such as gut biota, which are crucial for our overall health.",
                    "Genetic engineering, while potentially revolutionary in treating diseases and halting their spread, carries significant risks that we can't overlook. As technologies like CRISPR-CAS9 become more accessible and affordable, the barriers to misuse diminish. Imagine a future where a hobbyist can tinker with genetic material in their garage; the possibilities range from creating harmless curiosities to unleashing catastrophic biohazards. The ease of access could lead to unintended consequences, such as the creation of an airborne super-virus, which could spread rapidly and become a global threat. The potential for misuse and the ethical implications of such power make it crucial to regulate and carefully consider the application of genetic engineering on humans and animals."

Including:\n\n* Analysis of the mutations and how often they code for a new amino acid\n* Detection of how often & where mutations happened, and as compared to natural viruses\n* Detection of splice sites and insertion of transposons (AKA smoking guns of genetic manipulation) (or really, in this case, the lack thereof)\n* The determination of \u201c*overall statistical probability*\u201d incorporating 1-3.\n\nI know this is a bunch of dense science-y jargon.\n\n**Don\u2019t worry: I\u2019ll explain each in simpler phrasing below!**\n\n# 2.2.1) We can look at the genome, and see how often certain types of mutations are happening.\n\nNucleotides (A, T, G, and C) ([33](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Nucleotide)) are read by a cell and translated into one of 21+ amino acids ([34](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Amino-Acids)). This is called the \u201cUniversal Genetic Code\u201d ([35](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-molecular-genetics/hs-rna-and-protein-synthesis/a/the-genetic-code)). This is done in triplets of nucleotides (ATG, TCA, etc.) called \u201ccodons.\u201d\n\n*Yes I know it\u2019s Uracil in RNA. Do we really need to get into that right now?*\n\nThere is a sort of \u201credundancy\u201d in these codons, though. Where not every unique triplet of letters is a unique amino acid! As a result, not all nucleotide changes result in a new amino acid.\n\n[Here\u2019s](https://youtu.be/dijqYyFY1GM) a video that might help clarify this.\n\n*Nobody ever said nature was perfect. Far from it, I promise you.*\n\nWe can detect how often a nucleotide change resulted in an amino acid, and figure out whether or not it\u2019s too frequent to have occurred naturally. If it were, then it would be more likely that someone had deliberately changed these nucleotides to create specific amino acids. A change that results in a new amino acid is called \u201c*non-synonymous*\u201d and one that doesn\u2019t change anything is called \u201c*synonymous*.\u201d *Make sense?*\n\n*Kind of like how two words can be synonyms, but if you change the meaning of* *one of the words, they aren\u2019t synonyms anymore.*\n\n*I don\u2019t know why we biologists feel the need to come up with so many specific* *terms, but we do. That\u2019s the way it is. I\u2019m sorry!*\n\n**In the case of SARS-CoV-2, there are exactly the right amount of these** **\u201cnon-synonymous\u201d mutations to have occurred in nature, driven by natural** **selection.** A well-respected viral geneticist named Trevor Bedford, who is a professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center at The University of Washington already did this calculation for us. So I can just refer to his results, where he explains them in more detail ([36](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1224207086013149184.html)).\n\nHe found **only \\~14.2% of nucleotide changes actually reflected a change in** **amino acids.**\n\nHere are some analyses by other people that agree with Dr. Bedford\u2019s conclusions: ([16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9),[37](https://jvi.asm.org/content/early/2020/03/27/JVI.00411-20),[38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107875/))\n\n# 2.2.2) And these changes were also consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in other bat viruses!\n\nWhich means it is very likely this virus mutated in bats ([164](https://www.virology.ws/2020/02/20/pangolins-and-the-origin-of-sars-cov-2-coronavirus/),[165](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.048710v2)).\n\n**Some have talked about pangolins, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard** ([64](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2169-0))! But the main reason **pangolins probably aren\u2019t the origin** is that the pangolin viruses just aren\u2019t as close to SARS-CoV-2 ([163](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-no-evidence-coronavirus-jumped-pangolin-people)). And pangolin viruses don\u2019t look similar in the ways we would expect ([164](https://www.virology.ws/2020/02/20/pangolins-and-the-origin-of-sars-cov-2-coronavirus/),[165](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.048710v2))!\n\n# 2.2.3) If anyone had intentionally altered the genome of SARS-CoV-2, there'd be clues!\n\nMany of the most useful tools of genetic engineering known to science leave a sort of \u201cgenetic footprint\u201d that marks their use ([39](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4124),[40](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05736-3),[41](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/crispr-offshoot-still-makes-mistakes-editing-dna-raising-concerns-about-its-medical-use),[42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2874221/)).\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 is extremely popular for making changes in viruses ([43](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/genomeediting)). But it is not perfect! Occasionally, it will delete large stretches of letters, or screw up and shuffle stuff around. If someone had used CRISPR-Cas9 to make these 1200 mutations across the genome, it **likely** would have left *at least* one error behind.\n\n*This is because virus genomes are weird, yo*. They have lots of repetitive letters and other stuff that would confuse these editing tools ([44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3220689/)). Viruses are weird, and their genomes are weird.\n\n**No such traces of CRISPR use have been found in the genome of SARS-CoV-2** ([15](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30418-9/abstract),[45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161481/),[46](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2)).\n\nOther methods of genomic editing (intentional homologous recombination, sticky-end ligation) *could*, if done *extremely* carefully, make mutations without any trace. But, again, to do so with \\~1200 mutations across 30,000 bases would be A) extremely time consuming (think: *many many years*), B) difficult (think: *lots of people giving up and quitting*), and C) just plain not worth it\u2026 (think: *no rational or reasonable biologist would do it this* *way*)\n\nAnd, even then, you would need to make thousands of little strings of DNA called \u201ccustom oligo primers.\u201d Each one of these would have to be specific for a certain part of the virus. And you\u2019d need so many different ones, and for each set to work *perfectly* to not accidentally cause a \u201cstop codon\u201d (think *make a* *horribly disfigured version of the virus, that just withers and dies. A straight* *up monstrosity if you were a virus. Virus frankenstein.*)\n\nThat level of perfection with so many sets of primers just **does not happen**.\n\nNot in any lab I\u2019ve ever worked in, not in any lab I know about, not in any lab anyone\u2019s ever known about. *This is one of the dark dirty secrets of science*. **Stuff doesn\u2019t work the first time you try**. Or even the second. Entire PhDs are wasted trying to do this! *Years* of people\u2019s lives are lost to these ideas that don\u2019t work. Not every idea or project out there is equally easy to do. And the more complex and the more intricate, the less likely to work.\n\n*The idea of mutating (by hand) another virus to make SARS-CoV-2 is like* *watching the last season of GoT and gleefully telling yourself \u201cI won't be* *disappointed regardless of what happens!\u201d*   *In the beginning, you\u2019re patting yourself on the back when Rhaegal dies and* *everyone else is super mad. But by episode six, it becomes clear to you that* *this is just an unsalvageable mess and they might as well have just made all the* *characters into lumberjacks. You\u2019re now as angry as ever!*\n\n*It isn't possible.*\n\nNormally, you would order these primers from a company. Like the \u201c*Walmart of science*.\u201d And we\u2019d likely know by now if a Chinese lab had ordered so many oligo primers from the very few companies able to do this. *Any lab that wanted* *quality primers that would actually work would use an international* *corporation\u2019s oligo primers*. And these international companies aren\u2019t beholden to the Chinese government. This is also not something that we really are able to do in the lab itself, without a company, until *extremely* recently, in terms of sheer cost. Like this year. It just doesn\u2019t line up.\n\n**\\[** [**Prev**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpbagf/) **|** [**ToC**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/) **|** [**References**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vRbACWf90iBC35xNOwlI5bWcUq0nNzLc/view?usp=sharing) **|** [**Next**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/fqpby1u/) \\]",

We are directly running into fundamental incongruities with what \"works\" as a virus and what does not. With what it would look like, and how one would have to \"create\" it to make it look that way. \n\nThe increase in mutation speed is an example of this. It would seem so easy to just make it mutate faster, right? why not?? Because, as we have discovered over many decades of experiments, viruses don't give a crap about what you *want* to do. \n\nThey follow the path of stochastically fueled counter-entropy. They find the way to make the most of themselves they possibly can, no matter what. Even if \"making more of themselves\" means they catastrophically destroy themselves by mutating *too* much. Because you wanted them to move faster.\n\nThey just \"exist\" and the idea that we can \"optimize\" them better to overcome these fundamental problems (synonymous vs non-synonymous changes, mutation fixation rates, etc.) is just incompatible with how viruses work.\n\nI can make a virus that causes more damage but that's not a better virus it's arguably worse because it would burn out faster. Meaning of people die so quickly that the virus doesn't transmit very well and the pandemic would peter out. But to say that I would know how to make one like SARS-CoV-2, if I wanted to, I don't really think I could... It's just such a balancing act and this virus has done it very well, in a way I would not have predicted.\n\nMuch more of biology is spent figuring out how things work in nature than it is spent \"improving\" nature. We are doing many many hundreds of years of the former every day. And we are doing essentially none of the latter. At least not in virology.\n\nI can already hear someone say \"BUT WHAT ABOUT GAIN OF FUNCTION???\" -- That's also not how that works, in many respects. When you try and make viruses more transmissible, like influenza, they change in unexpected or expectedly screwed up ways... If you try and make influenza more transmissible, it becomes less lethal. \n\nThere are tradeoffs to everything, you can't \"**cheat**\" nature in 99% of cases.\n\nWe cannot *airbrush* viruses to make them look right. They don't care, they do what they have to to survive the way that random drift takes them.",

It's about finding a balance between innovation and ethical responsibility, ensuring that our advancements don't come at the cost of the creatures we modify."

By teaching their children at home, parents can tailor lessons to fit their kids' needs and values, creating a more personalized and impactful learning experience.",
                    "I totally get that life skills should primarily be taught by parents at home. I mean, that's where kids spend most of their time and where they learn the ropes of everyday life, right? But let's be real, not all parents are stepping up like they used to. Over the past decade, there's been a noticeable dip in the quality of parenting, and it's affecting how well kids are prepared for the real world. So while I think parents should be the main teachers of life skills, maybe schools could help fill in the gaps when home life isn't cutting it.",
                    "No way should schools be solely responsible for teaching life skills. Parents absolutely need to step up and teach their kids the basics. I mean, what else are they doing if not preparing their kids for real life? Schools have enough on their plate with academics; it's on parents to make sure their kids know how to cook a meal, manage money, or even do laundry. It's part of raising a well-rounded individual.",
                    "Not everything should fall on the shoulders of schools, and it's crucial to remember that parents play a fundamental role in teaching their kids essential life skills. Schools are already overloaded with academic responsibilities, and expecting them to cover everything from budgeting to cooking to emotional intelligence is unrealistic. This is where the importance of a strong family unit comes in, as parents are the ones who should be modeling and teaching these skills at home. After all, life skills are often best learned through real-life experiences and guidance from those closest to us, rather than in a classroom setting."

I mean, there's nothing wrong with *offering* a life skills course and I think some students would certainly take it/benefit from it, but I've always viewed a school's primary function to be academic education.\n\nI guess it all depends on how you look at schools: are they responsible to teach children everything they'll ever need as an adult or are they simply responsible for academic enrichment while parents/guardians are responsible for life skills? Because if it's the first, 8 hours a day is no where near enough.\n\nThe more responsibilities you dump on public schools, the less responsibilities they'll manage to fill.\n\nThen again, I'm looking at this from a middle-class perspective where almost everyone went on to college and high school was basically college prep. Maybe there's some perspective I'm missing due to that.",
                    "You seriously think it's too much for parents to be expected to teach their kids basic life skills?\n\nSomething else to consider: \"necessary life skills\" varies a lot from person to person. If you make those subjects required classes, you're still gonna get a ton of kids who believe it's a waste of time for them, and some of them will be right.\n\nAnd sure, it sucks that bad parents exist, but when schools are expected to take on more and more responsibilities for kids, academics suffer and that's not a good thing. Time and resources are limited. Instead, there should be other systems in place to deal with those issues, rather than putting the burden on schools.",
                    "We take away from the more specialized skills that we teach in schools right now. We teach these skills because it teaches kids *how to learn*,  plus there are a variety of different jobs that these skills **might** be useful in. However the  downside is that these skills are often wasted on those who don't do into those fields.  \n  \nIf we instead teach essential life skills like taxpaying, we can teach kids how to learn while simultaneously teaching them valuable skills we **know** they are going to need.",

So to add in all the things you just mentioned something would need to get cut. \n\nI\u2019m of the opinion that we as a society continue to push off more and more responsibility on the school system to solve or at least treat the symptoms of our shitty society. \n\nThe answer is that all these \u201clife skills\u201d should be taught by the parents/family. There is more ti parenting and raising kids than just providing food/shelter/clothing. Unfortunately like many have pointed out too many households don\u2019t get the quality time to do a lot of this. My solution would be to solve the problem of parents and family wasting away working all the time just to survive and allow them the opportunity to parent.

Plus, what even counts as \"necessary life skills\" is so subjective\u2014what's crucial for one kid might be a total waste of time for another. With limited time and resources, schools can't be everything for everyone, and piling on more responsibilities just means something else has to give.

Right now, schools focus on specialized skills that not only teach kids the subjects themselves but also how to learn. This approach is beneficial because it opens doors to a variety of careers, even if not every student ends up using all of the skills they learn. On the flip side, if we shift to teaching life skills like taxpaying, we risk losing the depth and breadth of knowledge that helps students adapt to different fields. While it's true that everyone will need to know how to manage their finances, the current system's emphasis on learning how to learn is invaluable and shouldn't be underestimated.",

It's like we're constantly expecting schools to patch up the cracks in our society, but that's not what they're designed for. The real solution is empowering parents and families to take on this role. Instead of overloading schools, we should focus on creating a society where parents aren't stretched so thin by work that they can't teach these essential skills at home. It's about giving families the chance to actually parent, rather than relying on schools to fill in the gaps.",

I mean, sure, schools might not be teaching the most useful life skills right now, but is it really worth the chaos it would cause to overhaul everything? Plus, who's to say what the \"right\" life skills are anyway? Everyone's life is different, and what one person needs might be totally irrelevant to someone else.

This makes it incredibly tough to find a one-size-fits-all approach that satisfies everyone, leading to delays and endless debates about what should be included and who gets to decide."

After all, the goal of society should be to support and uplift all its members, not just those who are naturally robust.",
                    "Modern medicine is often criticized for supposedly interfering with natural selection by allowing individuals who might otherwise not survive due to lack of common sense to continue living. Some argue that this results in a population that doesn't learn from mistakes or develop resilience. However, it's important to consider the alternative: without medical intervention, many would suffer slow, painful, and preventable deaths. While it's true that medicine can reduce the risks of injury and death, it also provides people the opportunity to recover and lead happy, healthy lives. This doesn't necessarily mean that evolution is stalling; rather, it reflects our capacity for compassion and innovation in improving quality of life.",
                    "Modern medicine has undeniably improved our ability to survive injuries and illnesses that would have been fatal in the past. This has led to a world where people who might lack basic survival instincts or common sense can still make it through situations that would have been deadly before. For instance, workplace injuries have decreased due to better safety standards, but modern conveniences like cars have introduced new risks. Despite these new challenges, the advent of advanced medical care means that even those who find themselves in dangerous situations, like soldiers on the battlefield, have a much higher chance of survival today compared to ancient times. This shift in survival dynamics means that natural selection pressures are different now, allowing more people to survive and reproduce, regardless of their instincts or decision-making skills.",
                    "Modern medicine, while undoubtedly a marvel in many respects, does have an unintended side effect on human evolution. By drastically reducing the risks of injury and death, it allows individuals who might lack basic survival instincts or common sense to thrive and reproduce. This is a significant point of discussion when examining the effects of medical advancements and our modern lifestyle. By cutting out factors like violent deaths from the equation, we see a clearer picture of how medicine has altered natural selection, potentially leading to a population that isn't as naturally resilient or adaptive as it might have been without these medical interventions."

Just as other intelligent animals demonstrate varying levels of consciousness and tool use, humans have taken it further by using our rational thinking to shape our environment and destiny, rather than be solely shaped by them.

You can find these injuries if you actually look for them, and the potential side effects are actually listed in the vaccine inserts (that your doctor won\u2019t give you). Not only that, but vaccine manufacturers have been deemed legally non liable for vaccine injuries, meaning if you or your child are permanently injured from one you cannot sue the vaccine manufacturer for damages related to the injury. This is because the manufacturers themselves said that the risk is inherently too high to make the vaccines if they weren\u2019t protected from the INEVITABLE injuries the vaccines would cause. Manufacturers refused to produce the vaccines if they weren\u2019t granted this immunity from legal damages. \n\nThis is experimentation on the grandest scale, and without a control group.",

And the doctors are reliant on the licenses and the manufacturers, plus they have a religious like faith in the process and products.\n\n- your government has proven that they will lie to you about the safety and efficacy of vaccines while illegally requiring you to take them and subsuming all responsibility for them with no accountability. And they've proven that they will also break the laws that require them to keep the vaccine program safe and transparent via reporting.\n\n- in the first world, it's extremely rare for unvaccinated people to be injured by the diseases targeted by vaccines\n\n- vaccines are not properly tested via preslicensing long term placebo testing. They don't even use proper controls on testing. They use placebos that are known to cause reactions, rather than saline. And they destroy their control groups by giving them the vaccine being tested.\n\n- they don't run any trials or research to understand the potential impacts of multiple vaccines, and they don't test for infectious disease outcomes outside the diseases the vaccines are specifically targeting.\n\nI could keep going. It's not to say that vaccines are bad as a concept or product, but its clear that the program is captured.",
                    "Vaccines, like almost all medicines, are researched and produced by for-profit companies. This alone should give people an opt-out if they want it. For-profit companies are incentivised by PROFIT which includes hiding true figures and making things look better than they are, bribing politicians and regulatory bodies including getting your own former executives into those roles (the revolving door) and introducing unnecessary barriers for competitors and harming the competition to keep your own product number one. I am not saying that this is how all corporations act; i am saying that a for-profit corporation is incentivised to act this way and thus any time they act altruistically is something that goes against their incentive. Which is not something that should be fundamentally relied upon as a mandatory expectation. So this is possible reason #1\n\nThere are millions of people who are medically exempt from certain types of treatments. For example (my memory is hazy on this one) a significant percentage of people are allergic to a certain type of vaccine which causes significant immune issues. When this is discovered it is meant to go on their medical record but rarely does. I trained a girl who a few years ago had a severe reaction to a certain type of vaccine and almost had her arm amputated due to it. They failed to note on her record that she had this reaction, she had a vaccine again a few years later and got life threatening sepsis from it. This is not the type of vaccine in terms of disease it prevents; it is about the method the vaccine uses to invoke an immune response. Some types just do not work with some people\u2019s immune systems. Because of the myth that \u2018all vaccines are 100% safe\u2019 that even nurses believe erroneously, vaccine allergies are often not recorded such as what happened with this girl, who still has scars on one arm from her issues. So medical exemptions is reason #2\n\nThere have been issues raised with manufacturing standards. I read a summary of a paper in New Scientist (i think, perhaps another journal review/roundup publisher like Science) of a test a few years ago (pre covid) that looked for contaminates that weren\u2019t meant to be present. I forget the exact figures but i was shocked, it was 100% of vaccines produced in china (which at the time was like 80% of vaccines) had contaminates that were not meant to be present. So the theory and design of the vaccines is immaterial if the actual practice of manufacturing them at scale introduces contaminants. This is something i haven\u2019t heard has been addressed. And, related to point number one about medicine being profit-driven, it is unlikely they would sort this issue out unless forced to because they are not called out on it. Which makes reason #3, manufacturing at scale is not producing vaccines at the safety rate of those used in testing in small batches\n\nTo make it clear, i am pro vaccine. If i wasn\u2019t pro vaccine i wouldn\u2019t care about whether they are safe or effective. It is precisely because i am pro vaccine that i want all vaccines to be safe and effective. This is why i am troubled by your first reason to discount all parent\u2019s concerns with an invasive medical treatment; that any concerns are clearly \u2018anti-vaccine conspiracy theory\u2019 and can be dismissed at will. This is a very dangerous attitude to have and it only benefits the massive pharmaceutical corporations that profit hugely from vaccine distribution annually. To turn a blind eye and give full benefit of the doubt to them is always going to be a mistake. If you want our children to have safe and effective vaccines then you should be the most critical of vaccines and their production, not giving it all a free pass\n\nMy final reason is one of concern and that is the approval process of vaccines. I read a letter in a journal a few years ago (again, pre covid, before the anti vaccine stuff really blew up) protesting the approval of the hepatitis b vaccine in newborns. This was because the industry had created a vaccine that was very effective for drug users and people with STDs. Unfortunately for them their very effective vaccine\u2019s target market was people who are unlikely to get vaccinated. The manufacturer (merck i think) had a BUSINESS (not medical) meeting to market their vaccine at a group that did not need it; newborns. The vaccine effectiveness was maximum 5 years. So they got approval for an STD vaccine in a group with very low rate of hepatitis b, babies, and at least in the US there has been hepatitis b vaccination in newborns ever since. This, to me, and to the author of the concern, is an indication that companies are not always creating these highly profitable medications in the best interests of users. Which is reason #4\n\nThere are a few minor reasons i think parents should be able to opt out but i think these are my main ones. PREVENTATIVE medication is often extremely cost effective and very worthwhile. Vaccines are one of the pinnacles of medical science. Everybody who is not a moron should want them to be as safe and as effective as humanly possible\n\nHowever i don\u2019t feel that they are as safe as humanity is capable of making them nor as effective as humanity is capable of making them. As long as they have an above-zero risk of side effect and as long as they are made with profit as the foremost purpose, there should be an opt-out. Parents should not be mandated to have their children receive this treatment. I think it is also against the international charter of human rights that you must take an invasive medicine (which includes any injections) against your will\n\nI am sure i will be fact checked to some degree and i would like to make clear that vaccines are definitely not something that make a big part of my life so this is just my very subjective memory of things that i read before covid (i have not had access to academic medical literature since 2019 so thats how i know it was all pre covid). So if i have misrepresented anything in this comment i greatly encourage any corrections, and thank you in advance",

Or, to put it a better way, refusing vaccines costs the lives of other people who didn't get a say in the decision. \n\nSo, it's a society-level problem, with the closest analogues being things like speed limits, where the justification (that most of us accept) is that we have our personal freedoms limited because the result is that fewer people die in fiery wrecks.",

If a vaccine had been available, it could have prevented all that misery and been way less invasive than locking her up. Just like the state can draft you for war, which is arguably a bigger infringement on personal freedom, it seems reasonable that they can require something as straightforward as a vaccine to protect public health.

Vaccines work similarly but on a broader scale; they protect not only the vaccinated but also those who can't be, like newborns. By mandating vaccines, we save lives and reduce the risk for everyone, much like how speed limits are imposed to prevent accidents.

                    "Vaccines, like almost all medicines, are researched and produced by for-profit companies. This alone should give people an opt-out if they want it. For-profit companies are incentivised by PROFIT which includes hiding true figures and making things look better than they are, bribing politicians and regulatory bodies including getting your own former executives into those roles (the revolving door) and introducing unnecessary barriers for competitors and harming the competition to keep your own product number one. I am not saying that this is how all corporations act; i am saying that a for-profit corporation is incentivised to act this way and thus any time they act altruistically is something that goes against their incentive. Which is not something that should be fundamentally relied upon as a mandatory expectation. So this is possible reason #1\n\nThere are millions of people who are medically exempt from certain types of treatments. For example (my memory is hazy on this one) a significant percentage of people are allergic to a certain type of vaccine which causes significant immune issues. When this is discovered it is meant to go on their medical record but rarely does. I trained a girl who a few years ago had a severe reaction to a certain type of vaccine and almost had her arm amputated due to it. They failed to note on her record that she had this reaction, she had a vaccine again a few years later and got life threatening sepsis from it. This is not the type of vaccine in terms of disease it prevents; it is about the method the vaccine uses to invoke an immune response. Some types just do not work with some people\u2019s immune systems. Because of the myth that \u2018all vaccines are 100% safe\u2019 that even nurses believe erroneously, vaccine allergies are often not recorded such as what happened with this girl, who still has scars on one arm from her issues. So medical exemptions is reason #2\n\nThere have been issues raised with manufacturing standards. I read a summary of a paper in New Scientist (i think, perhaps another journal review/roundup publisher like Science) of a test a few years ago (pre covid) that looked for contaminates that weren\u2019t meant to be present. I forget the exact figures but i was shocked, it was 100% of vaccines produced in china (which at the time was like 80% of vaccines) had contaminates that were not meant to be present. So the theory and design of the vaccines is immaterial if the actual practice of manufacturing them at scale introduces contaminants. This is something i haven\u2019t heard has been addressed. And, related to point number one about medicine being profit-driven, it is unlikely they would sort this issue out unless forced to because they are not called out on it. Which makes reason #3, manufacturing at scale is not producing vaccines at the safety rate of those used in testing in small batches\n\nTo make it clear, i am pro vaccine. If i wasn\u2019t pro vaccine i wouldn\u2019t care about whether they are safe or effective. It is precisely because i am pro vaccine that i want all vaccines to be safe and effective. This is why i am troubled by your first reason to discount all parent\u2019s concerns with an invasive medical treatment; that any concerns are clearly \u2018anti-vaccine conspiracy theory\u2019 and can be dismissed at will. This is a very dangerous attitude to have and it only benefits the massive pharmaceutical corporations that profit hugely from vaccine distribution annually. To turn a blind eye and give full benefit of the doubt to them is always going to be a mistake. If you want our children to have safe and effective vaccines then you should be the most critical of vaccines and their production, not giving it all a free pass\n\nMy final reason is one of concern and that is the approval process of vaccines. I read a letter in a journal a few years ago (again, pre covid, before the anti vaccine stuff really blew up) protesting the approval of the hepatitis b vaccine in newborns. This was because the industry had created a vaccine that was very effective for drug users and people with STDs. Unfortunately for them their very effective vaccine\u2019s target market was people who are unlikely to get vaccinated. The manufacturer (merck i think) had a BUSINESS (not medical) meeting to market their vaccine at a group that did not need it; newborns. The vaccine effectiveness was maximum 5 years. So they got approval for an STD vaccine in a group with very low rate of hepatitis b, babies, and at least in the US there has been hepatitis b vaccination in newborns ever since. This, to me, and to the author of the concern, is an indication that companies are not always creating these highly profitable medications in the best interests of users. Which is reason #4\n\nThere are a few minor reasons i think parents should be able to opt out but i think these are my main ones. PREVENTATIVE medication is often extremely cost effective and very worthwhile. Vaccines are one of the pinnacles of medical science. Everybody who is not a moron should want them to be as safe and as effective as humanly possible\n\nHowever i don\u2019t feel that they are as safe as humanity is capable of making them nor as effective as humanity is capable of making them. As long as they have an above-zero risk of side effect and as long as they are made with profit as the foremost purpose, there should be an opt-out. Parents should not be mandated to have their children receive this treatment. I think it is also against the international charter of human rights that you must take an invasive medicine (which includes any injections) against your will\n\nI am sure i will be fact checked to some degree and i would like to make clear that vaccines are definitely not something that make a big part of my life so this is just my very subjective memory of things that i read before covid (i have not had access to academic medical literature since 2019 so thats how i know it was all pre covid). So if i have misrepresented anything in this comment i greatly encourage any corrections, and thank you in advance",

We have to question the true correlation between vaccines and diseases, especially when all studies are funded by the pharmaceutical companies themselves, with government officials often having ties to these industries. It's concerning that adverse effects like 'turbo cancers' and myocarditis have been rising, yet any suggestion of a link to vaccines, especially the COVID vaccine, is met with backlash.

While not all corporations act unethically, the profit-driven nature of these companies means that altruistic actions are not guaranteed and shouldn't be relied upon as a basis for mandatory medical treatments. Additionally, there are legitimate medical exemptions that must be considered, as some individuals can suffer severe allergic reactions to certain vaccines, which are often not properly recorded. Manufacturing standards also raise concerns, with reports of contaminants in vaccines produced at scale, which compromises safety. Furthermore, the approval process for vaccines can be influenced by business interests rather than medical necessity, as seen with the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns. These factors suggest that while vaccines are crucial, there should be an opt-out option to ensure that individuals are not forced into medical treatments that may not be in their best interest.",

                "opinion": "Vaccines are not sufficiently effective to justify making them mandatory.",
                "top5_matches": [
                    "Vaccines, like almost all medicines, are researched and produced by for-profit companies. This alone should give people an opt-out if they want it. For-profit companies are incentivised by PROFIT which includes hiding true figures and making things look better than they are, bribing politicians and regulatory bodies including getting your own former executives into those roles (the revolving door) and introducing unnecessary barriers for competitors and harming the competition to keep your own product number one. I am not saying that this is how all corporations act; i am saying that a for-profit corporation is incentivised to act this way and thus any time they act altruistically is something that goes against their incentive. Which is not something that should be fundamentally relied upon as a mandatory expectation. So this is possible reason #1\n\nThere are millions of people who are medically exempt from certain types of treatments. For example (my memory is hazy on this one) a significant percentage of people are allergic to a certain type of vaccine which causes significant immune issues. When this is discovered it is meant to go on their medical record but rarely does. I trained a girl who a few years ago had a severe reaction to a certain type of vaccine and almost had her arm amputated due to it. They failed to note on her record that she had this reaction, she had a vaccine again a few years later and got life threatening sepsis from it. This is not the type of vaccine in terms of disease it prevents; it is about the method the vaccine uses to invoke an immune response. Some types just do not work with some people\u2019s immune systems. Because of the myth that \u2018all vaccines are 100% safe\u2019 that even nurses believe erroneously, vaccine allergies are often not recorded such as what happened with this girl, who still has scars on one arm from her issues. So medical exemptions is reason #2\n\nThere have been issues raised with manufacturing standards. I read a summary of a paper in New Scientist (i think, perhaps another journal review/roundup publisher like Science) of a test a few years ago (pre covid) that looked for contaminates that weren\u2019t meant to be present. I forget the exact figures but i was shocked, it was 100% of vaccines produced in china (which at the time was like 80% of vaccines) had contaminates that were not meant to be present. So the theory and design of the vaccines is immaterial if the actual practice of manufacturing them at scale introduces contaminants. This is something i haven\u2019t heard has been addressed. And, related to point number one about medicine being profit-driven, it is unlikely they would sort this issue out unless forced to because they are not called out on it. Which makes reason #3, manufacturing at scale is not producing vaccines at the safety rate of those used in testing in small batches\n\nTo make it clear, i am pro vaccine. If i wasn\u2019t pro vaccine i wouldn\u2019t care about whether they are safe or effective. It is precisely because i am pro vaccine that i want all vaccines to be safe and effective. This is why i am troubled by your first reason to discount all parent\u2019s concerns with an invasive medical treatment; that any concerns are clearly \u2018anti-vaccine conspiracy theory\u2019 and can be dismissed at will. This is a very dangerous attitude to have and it only benefits the massive pharmaceutical corporations that profit hugely from vaccine distribution annually. To turn a blind eye and give full benefit of the doubt to them is always going to be a mistake. If you want our children to have safe and effective vaccines then you should be the most critical of vaccines and their production, not giving it all a free pass\n\nMy final reason is one of concern and that is the approval process of vaccines. I read a letter in a journal a few years ago (again, pre covid, before the anti vaccine stuff really blew up) protesting the approval of the hepatitis b vaccine in newborns. This was because the industry had created a vaccine that was very effective for drug users and people with STDs. Unfortunately for them their very effective vaccine\u2019s target market was people who are unlikely to get vaccinated. The manufacturer (merck i think) had a BUSINESS (not medical) meeting to market their vaccine at a group that did not need it; newborns. The vaccine effectiveness was maximum 5 years. So they got approval for an STD vaccine in a group with very low rate of hepatitis b, babies, and at least in the US there has been hepatitis b vaccination in newborns ever since. This, to me, and to the author of the concern, is an indication that companies are not always creating these highly profitable medications in the best interests of users. Which is reason #4\n\nThere are a few minor reasons i think parents should be able to opt out but i think these are my main ones. PREVENTATIVE medication is often extremely cost effective and very worthwhile. Vaccines are one of the pinnacles of medical science. Everybody who is not a moron should want them to be as safe and as effective as humanly possible\n\nHowever i don\u2019t feel that they are as safe as humanity is capable of making them nor as effective as humanity is capable of making them. As long as they have an above-zero risk of side effect and as long as they are made with profit as the foremost purpose, there should be an opt-out. Parents should not be mandated to have their children receive this treatment. I think it is also against the international charter of human rights that you must take an invasive medicine (which includes any injections) against your will\n\nI am sure i will be fact checked to some degree and i would like to make clear that vaccines are definitely not something that make a big part of my life so this is just my very subjective memory of things that i read before covid (i have not had access to academic medical literature since 2019 so thats how i know it was all pre covid). So if i have misrepresented anything in this comment i greatly encourage any corrections, and thank you in advance",
                    "Rebuttal:  Your argument lacks internal consistency. \n\nDetails: \n\nMost of the vaccines on the vaccine schedule you refer to have comparable mortality rates to the exceptions you provided.  I think you need to better flesh out which vaccines should be mandatory and why.  \n\nWhat is the \u201cgood\u201d that outweighs the \u201cmoral harm\u201d you allude to?

Do you think no one thought to do that, ha?",
                    "To be clear, most people advocate for forced medical treatment. An obvious example would be in the case where a child is sick, at risk of dying, and the parents are refusing treatment. The justification is that the treatment is in the best interest of the child.\n\nIt's not wildly different in the case of vaccines, they just operate on a different scale. Widespread vaccination protects not just the people directly vaccinated, but also the people who have not been, or cannot be, vaccinated (the newly born, for example).\n\nMandating vaccinations against common diseases, with vaccines with incredible safety records, doubtless saves lives. Or, to put it a better way, refusing vaccines costs the lives of other people who didn't get a say in the decision. \n\nSo, it's a society-level problem, with the closest analogues being things like speed limits, where the justification (that most of us accept) is that we have our personal freedoms limited because the result is that fewer people die in fiery wrecks."

The fact that they are researched and produced by for-profit companies raises concerns about their true efficacy and safety. These companies are driven by profit, which can lead to questionable practices like manipulating data, influencing regulatory bodies, and prioritizing market dominance over public health. Moreover, there are significant numbers of individuals who experience adverse reactions to vaccines, sometimes severe, due to allergies or other medical conditions. These instances highlight that vaccines are not universally safe for everyone, contradicting the myth that they are 100% safe and effective. Additionally, issues with manufacturing standards, such as contamination, further undermine confidence in the safety of vaccines produced at scale. The approval process for vaccines can also be influenced by business interests, as seen with the hepatitis B vaccine being marketed to newborns, a group not at high risk for the disease. Until vaccines are as safe and effective as possible, and the profit motive is not the primary driver, there should be an opt-out option for parents.

It's really not that complicated to compare the health outcomes of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children to determine a vaccine's effectiveness.

                    "While it's true that vaccines have a remarkable safety record and play a crucial role in protecting public health, some argue that their effectiveness isn't sufficient to justify making them mandatory worldwide. The comparison to forced medical treatment in life-threatening situations highlights the ethical dilemma: is it right to impose a medical intervention on everyone for the greater good? Vaccines do protect both the vaccinated and those who cannot be vaccinated, like newborns, but mandating them raises questions about personal freedom and bodily autonomy. Just as speed limits are set to reduce accidents, the idea of mandatory vaccination is to prevent disease outbreaks, yet the debate remains whether this level of intervention is justified given the varying effectiveness of different vaccines."

I was on half of that when my doc mentioned i was \u201cat the limit\u201d one year.  Strange, did i read wrong?  Was there new research?  No, the clinic system had just decided to slash it in half to set their own limit\u2026 im assuming for liability & DEA pressure more than actual concern for patients. \n\nThe next year i was hospitalized for a few days, & they refused to give me my meds on a regular schedule.  They said it was far superseding the \u2018safe daily limit\u2019 according to the automated system (which i knew was not true).  After 48hrs Doubled over in pain i had to fight to get an actual doctor to speak to my doctor & manually clear *giving me my own effing meds* id been on for years with no problem.  Turns out *that* facility had just arbitrarily slashed the limit down by 3/4ths.  They had it automated to cut off at 25% of the safe daily dose, & spent 2 days gaslighting me into believing i was crazy & doing something wrong \ud83d\ude10\n\nSorry that was a venting rant for non-adhd meds, but im trying to get back in treatment for adhd (& anxiety) now & seeing the same issues spreading to everything.  I believe a majority of docs & clinics have been put under SO much pressure (& outright threat of being \u201cflagged\u201d & penalized) that they\u2019re slashing their own controlled med guidelines intentionally to push out those types of patients.  Slim down their rolls for restricted prescribing data, & only treat the ones that dont give up.\n\nThe problem is that patients don\u2019t just give up on getting medication & go live a better unmedicated life\u2026 they\u2019re often forced to give up on life completely.  Depression, desperate self-medicating, disability & suicide.  Meanwhile the streets are still flooded with illicit drug use & fentanyl deaths\u2026 good job \ud83d\udc4c We\u2019ve screwed it up so badly that now its \u2018safer\u2019 for clinicians & systems to phase out all those legit patients requiring restricted meds, & refuse to treat new ones.  \n\nMaybe someday soon we\u2019ll have ADHD/Anxiety clinics, where you\u2019ll have to drop everything & travel in for on-demand piss tests 52 times a year & pay exorbitant visit & lab costs\u2026 like \u201cpain management clinics\u201d, where the goal seems to be to weed out anyone unable to fight for treatment.  But the *most* vulnerable patients who need treatment are often those that *can\u2019t* jump through all the hoops (& expenses) to fight.\n\nWe\u2019ve really screwed things up \ud83e\udee4",

I personally have never seen this happen yet, because after learning this they usually back down, or more commonly, accept their loved one\u2019s decision.

My husband and I both filled ours out, and I\u2019ve talked numerous times with him and my friends/families of the importance of these documents/sharing your wishes.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if people aren\u2019t registering to be organ donors because 1) they are letting their family decide for them or 2) they believe that saying \u201cno\u201d at the BMV means that\u2019s their \u201copt out\u201d. But I honestly love talking to the families of non-registered patients the most. There\u2019s a lot of misconceptions of donation out there so providing them the support and education, and giving them the power to choose for their loved one during a time in their life they feel powerless and filled with grief\u2014to offer a silver lining during the worst time of their life gives them a little hope. \n\nSorry for the rant again, but what it comes down to is more people discussing what they want at the end of their lives, filing out an Advance Directive/Living Will, and really reading about organ donation and what it entails.

An opt-out system could be seen as presumptive, taking away the individual's right to make a personal decision about their body, which is why explicit consent remains a vital part of respecting both the deceased and their family's values.",
                    "Yeah, that's not how the law works. Just because someone has passed away doesn't mean their body is free game for anything, including organ donation. The idea of an opt-out system raises concerns about consent and respect for the deceased. If we don't explicitly have the deceased's or their family's consent, it feels like we're overstepping boundaries, much like how the law doesn't allow other forms of disrespect to a corpse. It's important to have clear consent to ensure that we're honoring the wishes of the individual and their family, rather than assuming it's okay to use their body parts simply because they're no longer alive.",
                    "While it's true that after you pass, people will inevitably handle your belongings unless you specify otherwise in a will, there's a distinct difference when it comes to your body. The idea of medical professionals handling your organs without explicit consent feels a lot more personal and invasive than family sorting through your possessions. It's not just about who touches your things, but the nature of what they're touching. Many people feel that the sanctity of the body should be respected and that using parts of a deceased person's body without clear permission could easily be seen as a violation or desecration. In this context, having fewer people automatically granted access to your body might be preferable to ensure that your wishes are respected.",
                    "The idea that the dead are non-entities and thus have no rights is a slippery slope. If we go down that path, it opens the door to morally questionable practices like graverobbing or even necrophilia, which society rightfully condemns. Just because someone has passed away doesn't mean their body becomes public property. The deceased deserve respect, and their bodily integrity should be preserved, especially when it comes to their internal organs. Using their organs without explicit consent from them or their families is not just a legal issue but a deeply ethical one, and bypassing this consent is disturbingly disrespectful."

I'm going to assume you're pro choice since your post suggests you're more left-leaning. In the case of abortion, I believe the moral underpinnings of the pro choice position is that the well-being of the human capable of suffering takes priority over that of the potential human for which we have no reason to believe can suffer (yet), hence only the woman can decide if she should continue the pregnancy, even if against the wishes of the father.

Politically I am not in favor of additional regulation regulating social media platforms as a \"service\" (whatever distinction that might mean). I am in favor of applying Section 230 accurately.  \n\n\nThere are many popular misconceptions about Section 230. I myself wasn't too familiar with the provision so I had fallen for the \"platform vs. publisher\" debate myself.. I found this article and found it pretty persuasive and rooted in fact.

I think this gets murkier when the social media platform starts editorializing posts by adding \"misinformation\" tags, factchecks, and removing content with a \"misinformation\" warning, while trying to say \"oh no, its a third party fact checker that is doing the speaking with these factchecks and misinformation tags.\"   I think that's misleading and dishonest, and facebook or twitter ARE the speaker/creator when they label something misinformation, and should be held accountable if they are wrong about that.  \n\n\nIs Twitter and facebooks censorship of conservatives a violation of the first amendment? No. they're not the government, and can create rules for their services. However, does that mean its a good thing to do and we shouldn't criticize it?  I think ethically Twitter and facebook are behaving badly.  And its not hard to envision a world where a few social media platforms monopolize the entire public political discourse and anoint themselves the arbiters of whats \"true\" and whats not. That's not a fun world. The appropriate remedy there would be actually breaking up monopolies like facebook and twitter. Though liberals would still most likely be in charge of the cultural narrative across the board still anyway.   \n\n\nWhich underlines the real issue, which is conservatives really aren't doing well in the culture war and appealing to youth. Sure, we can point to the whackos who's policies aren't based mathematically in reality. You can point out that drag queen story hour for children is probably not cool, and that issuing $1,000 per month to every person in America would equal roughly the entire current US budget.  But being conservative just isn't cool anymore, and we don't have any of the cool people to really gain control of the cultural narrative, regardless of how unsound some democrat policies may be.

As an attorney, I see the importance of applying Section 230 accurately, which protects platforms from being held liable for user-generated content while allowing them to moderate without being considered publishers. The real issue arises when platforms like Facebook and Twitter start editorializing content by tagging or removing posts as \"misinformation,\" which blurs the lines of their role and accountability. Instead of government intervention, we should focus on breaking up monopolies to prevent a few platforms from controlling public discourse and dictating what is considered \"true,\" while also addressing the cultural divide that leaves conservatives struggling to appeal to younger generations.",

While it's true that nothing is truly apolitical or unbiased nowadays, social media companies do have a moral duty to prevent the spread of harmful misinformation. These platforms have started to take responsibility by blocking blatant lies, which is a positive step in protecting democracy and public safety. If the government steps in to regulate, it could lead to censorship or a one-size-fits-all approach that doesn't account for the nuances of free expression.",

By trying to control what platforms like Twitter can or cannot allow, they're essentially doing the exact thing they claim to be protecting us from\u2014restricting free expression. Plus, Twitter isn't a public space; it's a private company, so imposing government rules on it is like trying to force someone to speak a certain way in their own home. It's not just impractical; it's a massive overreach that flies in the face of the First Amendment.",
                    "Totally agree. The First Amendment is all about keeping the government from messing with your speech, not private companies like Twitter or Facebook. If the government starts regulating social media, it could end up stifling the very freedom it's supposed to protect. Platforms should have the flexibility to manage their own communities without Uncle Sam stepping in and telling them what they can or can't allow. Let the users and the companies work it out, rather than adding a layer of bureaucracy that could stifle innovation and expression.",
                    "Government regulation may limit the degree to which social media platforms allow free speech. When you bring the government into the mix, you're basically inviting them to decide what's acceptable speech and what's not, which is a slippery slope. Instead of government overreach, why not let the platforms themselves handle it? They can set their own community guidelines and let users decide if they want to be part of that space. Plus, with more government control, you risk stifling innovation and creativity in the tech industry. Let's keep the balance by encouraging transparency and accountability from the companies themselves, rather than handing over the reins to the government."

This distinction is crucial because it means platforms aren't acting as publishers, but rather as facilitators of free expression. The real issue lies in how these platforms sometimes editorialize content by tagging posts as misinformation, which can be misleading and should be scrutinized.

Politically I am not in favor of additional regulation regulating social media platforms as a \"service\" (whatever distinction that might mean). I am in favor of applying Section 230 accurately.  \n\n\nThere are many popular misconceptions about Section 230. I myself wasn't too familiar with the provision so I had fallen for the \"platform vs. publisher\" debate myself.. I found this article and found it pretty persuasive and rooted in fact. [https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201017/13051145526/section-230-basics-there-is-no-such-thing-as-publisher-or-platform-distinction.shtml](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201017/13051145526/section-230-basics-there-is-no-such-thing-as-publisher-or-platform-distinction.shtml)    \nSo it isn't about platform vs publisher, its just that the creator of the content can be held liable, the platform itself not.  I think this gets murkier when the social media platform starts editorializing posts by adding \"misinformation\" tags, factchecks, and removing content with a \"misinformation\" warning, while trying to say \"oh no, its a third party fact checker that is doing the speaking with these factchecks and misinformation tags.\"   I think that's misleading and dishonest, and facebook or twitter ARE the speaker/creator when they label something misinformation, and should be held accountable if they are wrong about that.  \n\n\nIs Twitter and facebooks censorship of conservatives a violation of the first amendment? No. they're not the government, and can create rules for their services. However, does that mean its a good thing to do and we shouldn't criticize it?  I think ethically Twitter and facebook are behaving badly.  And its not hard to envision a world where a few social media platforms monopolize the entire public political discourse and anoint themselves the arbiters of whats \"true\" and whats not. That's not a fun world. The appropriate remedy there would be actually breaking up monopolies like facebook and twitter. Though liberals would still most likely be in charge of the cultural narrative across the board still anyway.   \n\n\nWhich underlines the real issue, which is conservatives really aren't doing well in the culture war and appealing to youth. Sure, we can point to the whackos who's policies aren't based mathematically in reality. You can point out that drag queen story hour for children is probably not cool, and that issuing $1,000 per month to every person in America would equal roughly the entire current US budget.  But being conservative just isn't cool anymore, and we don't have any of the cool people to really gain control of the cultural narrative, regardless of how unsound some democrat policies may be.  Saying \"racism is bad! and people should get healthcare for free and the rich will pay for it!\" just sounds better, regardless of how little thought is being put into the actual nuance of these issues.",

The digital age has transformed what used to be private family moments into content that can be accessed by anyone, often leading to privacy and safety issues. Many people find the widespread sharing of children's images online to be unsettling, as it can attract unwanted attention from strangers and create a permanent digital footprint that the child did not consent to. Furthermore, the long-term implications of having these images online, such as their potential impact on future job prospects or educational opportunities, are often overlooked. Instead of public sharing, some families choose to keep these moments private, sharing them only with trusted individuals, which still allows for meaningful connections without compromising the child's privacy or safety.",

This can be especially beneficial for large families spread out over different regions, as it allows children to feel connected to family members they might not see often. While it's important to respect privacy and individual family rules, sharing select moments online can help children build a sense of identity and social ties with their family history.",

This distinction is important because it highlights that partial brain damage can lead to significant impairments, but total brain death means the end of all cognitive function.

Determinism lays out the conditions, but within that, we can still make meaningful decisions. So, while everything might be influenced by prior causes, that doesn't strip us of the ability to choose\u2014it just shapes the options available to us.",

By defining free will as a general sense of autonomy\u2014freedom from direct coercion like being held at gunpoint\u2014we can acknowledge its existence without denying the deterministic influences that shape our choices. This perspective aligns with a compatibilist view, where we accept that our decisions are influenced by prior causes yet still experience a sense of freedom within those constraints.

Free will skeptics argue that without a clear, consistent definition, discussions become muddled. When we talk about free will, we're diving into metaphysical territory, questioning whether our choices are truly ours or pre-determined by a chain of prior events. However, defining free will in a way that acknowledges determinism can reveal that these ideas aren't necessarily at odds.

For example, some definitions of free will focus on the ability to act according to one's desires and intentions, even if those desires and intentions have deterministic origins. So, while every action might have a cause, that doesn't automatically negate the experience of making choices. It's all about how we frame the discussion\u2014determinism doesn't have to cancel out free will if we redefine what freedom means in a deterministic universe.",

Instead, if we take a step back and redefine what we mean by free will and determinism, we might find that they can coexist. Free will isn't necessarily about being completely unconstrained by prior events; it can be about making choices within the framework of those events. When we redefine freedom as the ability to make decisions based on our desires and reasoning, even if those desires and reasoning are influenced by prior causes, it becomes clear that free will and determinism aren't necessarily in conflict."

Different cultures have their own interpretations and beliefs regarding ghosts. Some view them as malevolent or vengeful entities, while others see them as benevolent or neutral forces.  \nIn some religions, the concept of ghosts is closely tied to ideas about the afterlife, reincarnation, and the existence of a spirit world. \n\nFor example, in Chinese culture, the \"Preta Festival\" is a traditional Buddhist and Taoist festival where offerings are made to appease and honor deceased ancestors and wandering spirits. A \"Preta\" is a type of supernatural being or entity that is believed to exist in a state of suffering and deprivation which we translate as \"hungry ghost\" - but that's not an exact rendering of what is meant in Buddhism.\n\nAnother example, the term \"Holy Ghost\" has its roots in Old English. In the early English translations of the Bible, such as the King James Version (KJV) which was published in 1611, the word \"ghost\" was used to translate the Greek word \"pneuma,\" which means \"breath\". In Hebrew, the term for \"Holy Spirit\" is \"\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9,\" pronounced as \"Ruach HaKodesh.\" \"\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\" (Ruach) means \"spirit\" or \"wind,\" and \"\u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9\" (HaKodesh) means \"the holy\" or \"the sacred.\"  not the same thing at all as \"ghost\".\n\nIn ancient Greek culture, the concept of a ghost or spirit was referred to as a \"shade\" or \"soul\" (psyche). They were often associated with the afterlife and could not interact with the living.\n\nRoman beliefs about ghosts were influenced by Greek ideas, but they also had their own concepts. Romans believed in various types of spirits, including lemures (restless or malevolent spirits) and manes (beneficent ancestral spirits). The Lemuria festival was held in May to appease and protect against these malevolent spirits.\n\nIn Norse mythology, the concept of a ghost or spirit was closely tied to beliefs about the afterlife. The Norse believed in various realms, including Hel, which was associated with the dead. The spirits of the deceased were thought to inhabit these realms, and there were various rituals and beliefs surrounding interactions with the dead.\n\nCeltic beliefs about spirits and the afterlife varied across different regions and time periods. Some Celtic cultures believed in the existence of \"sidhe\" or fairy folk, which could be benevolent or malevolent spirits. There were also beliefs in ancestral spirits and various supernatural entities.\n\nMy point is, when you define\"ghosts\", you are primarily referring to how the concept came to us mainly through Germanic & Anglo-Saxon mythology: the wild hunt, draugr, revenants, barrow-wights, H\u00e1vam\u00e1l, etc. And even here, in the same root language and mythology, these concepts are widely different.\n\nWe've lodged concepts from other mythologies onto \"ghosts\" by translation, but on closer inspection, those concepts have very little in common."

It wasn't easy for her, but she managed, and we're all doing fine.\n\nI'm not addressing OP for a change of view with my anecdote here.

                    "Few things to get out of the way - kids \\*are\\* expensive, and there is definitely a minimum threshold of resources required to be able to support them. I'm not even basing my estimates on particularly unnecessary things, as even with good use of libraries or kid-to-kid programs for cheap trading and swapping of kid gear (strollers, clothes, toys, etc), kids require food, medicine, and daycare/school. I'm going to assume America here, because frankly, a lot of other countries prioritize children more than we do, so will agree that the bare minimum cost to child rearing is significant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, depending on how frugally you're willing to be, and it's not as high as you may imagine, and is in fact, quite a bit cheaper than a lot of other financial decisions people make that also impacts other people. Again, I \\*agree\\* that there is a minimum cost for child rearing, and it is particularly unfortunate that if not met, a child suffers, and this is bad. But what I do think is important to recognize is that a lot of things can be described similarly.\n\nFor example, we don't have any laws really around the choice that consenting age appropriate makes to smoke, or drink (barring driving drunk, as an obvious). We don't have any laws in place regulating people's decision to purchase lottery tickets or buy into pyramid schemes or lean on hobbies to the point of financial irresponsibility. A great deal of our economy in fact is built around the presumption that a lot of people are irresponsible with their money!\n\nSo, to this end, I don't disagree that children are expensive, and people should really be smart when it comes to the choice to have them. But I think you're sort of fixating on the parents financial decision here, and ignoring a lot of other mitigating factors. As a consideration, for example, having a kid definitely strained the hell out of my finances, to the point of definitely requiring some significant changes in my spending habits, but I don't think anything I've ever done has brought me the same level of joy. So, how do I put a price point on that investment/choice? How do you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Follow-up - As a consideration, a lot of issues are more worth tackling than 'kids are expensive'. A better issue to point to would be 'America does not prioritize financially caring for children, and that is shameful, and the decision to have children should not be something only available to the wealthy'.",
                    "I find your car analogy a bad one, because in addition to the cost of the lease, you also have the cost of maintaining and operating the vehicle.  Further, cars are a depreciating asset, and while you will probably be able to sell $230,000  car in 18 years for some reasonable amount of its initial cost, you will most likely only lose money in the exchange.\n\nOf course every analogy is flawed, so let's not pick that apart anymore.  Instead, lets focus on what I see as the major points of your argument:\n\n* Raising kids is a consistent financial draw on a person's (or ideally a couple's) finances, causing them to have more undue stress in their life than they would otherwise.\n* Having kids in a poor financial situation is cruel, or at least inconsiderate of the potential child's feelings and future well-being. As a result, there are social programs to support poor families that  (as implied) might not be there otherwise.\n\nRegarding the first point, I want to quote the USDA in their most recent article on the cost of raising a child:.\n\n \n\n>Expenses also increase as a child ages.\u00a0 Overall annual expenses averaged about $300 less for children from birth to 2 years old, and averaged $900 more for teenagers between 15-17 years of age. Teenagers have higher food costs as well as higher transportation costs as these are the years they start to drive so insurance is included or a maybe a second car is purchased for them.  \n>  \n>Regional variation was also observed. Families in the urban Northeast spent the most on a child, followed by families in the urban West, urban South, and urban Midwest.\u00a0 Families in rural areas throughout the country spent the least on a child\u2014child-rearing expenses were 27% lower in rural areas than the urban Northeast, primarily due to lower housing and child care/education expenses.  \n>  \n>Child-rearing expenses are subject to economies of scale. That is, with each additional child, expenses on each declines. For married-couple families with one child, expenses averaged 27% more per child than expenses in a two-child family.\u00a0 For families with three or more children, per child expenses averaged 24% less on each child than on a child in a two-child family.\u00a0 This is sometimes referred to as the \u201ccheaper by the dozen\u201d effect. Each additional child costs less because children can share a bedroom; a family can buy food in larger, more economical quantities; clothing and toys can be handed down; and older children can often babysit younger ones.  \n>  \n>[The Cost of Raising a Child](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/01/13/cost-raising-child)\n\nThis suggests to me that while one might initially be unable to afford a child, if a couple (or individual) seeking to raise child(ren) expects to have a higher income when the children are older, then they might not look like they could afford a child at the moment, but could certainly afford a child in course of their career.  \n\nFurther, what it means to afford a child varies quite widely, even in the U.S. so that a couple which might not be able to afford a child in one city would certainly be able to afford a child in a different location.  This is not even accounting for the benefits of living close to extended family, if that option is available.\n\nIn other words, what it means to 'afford' a child is difficult to quantify (even given your implicit definition of an ability to obtain the basics of life) as the costs of raising a child are NOT static over the two decades or so of raising the child.\n\nTo the other point about quality of life, I would like to point you to [the following article.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-happiness-doctor/201709/does-having-children-make-us-happy)  While this asks about overall parent happiness, I do feel that there are several salient points here.  \n\nFirst, to your statement that\n\n> having a kid, even beyond the sheer cost, makes your already struggling life even harder arbitrarily, and also worsens the quality of life for the child i.e. another human being; a luxury vehicle isn't going to wake you up crying every night \n\nI feel that this is probably a view determined by your upbringing in the U. S. as the article points out,\n\n> The country with the largest happiness deficit related to having children was the United States. \n\nThere are perhaps several reasons for this, but one that I find very interesting is that\n\n> The differences seem to come down to whether the nation has social policies that help parents face the challenges of balancing paid work with the responsibilities of child-rearing. Countries such as Norway, where parents are happier than nonparents, tend to have family-friendly policies, including paid parental leave, affordable and subsidized child care, more [government](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/politics)\\-protected paid vacation and sick days, and greater work schedule flexibility. These social policies were important to the happiness of both mothers and fathers. In fact, *both* parents and nonparents were happier in countries with these social policies in place. Government and corporate policies that support children\u2019s well-being seem to benefit society as a whole; for example, these policies are linked to lower [crime](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/law-and-crime) rates and increased [productivity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/productivity). \n\nSo instead of saying, as many in the United States often do\n\n>... society has to step in and help foot the bill for their wellbeing. I'm not opposed to this happening, but it is worth noting it wouldnt generally even have to be a thing if people who cant afford kids didnt have them. \n\n The U.S. might be better off if they said something more like \"These policies are generally good for a society as a whole, and as a benefit they allow more people to have children.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltimately, I suspect your reason for this CMV is more along the lines of your surprise at people's vehement reaction to the suggestion that some people are irresponsibly having children.  I will not deny that some people should think a lot more carefully before trying to raise children.  But I do not think that as many people would get very angry if you put it that way.  \n\nI think the real anger here stems from the issue that the curtailing of reproductive rights for any reason is a dark (and unfinished!) chapter in human history. Your statement as expressed sounds very close to those ideas and this is PART of why such strong emotions run counter to your argument.  It sounds mostly like you are suggesting that financially unstable people shouldn't have kids, which sounds like eugenics against poor people.  It doesn't help that most of the poor people in the U. S. are racial minorities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, as a personal anecdote, my wife and I decided to have kids before I finish my PhD because we would likely not be able to have the family size we wanted if we waited first.  We cannot 'afford' kids right now because we are not earning enough money.  It is difficult and it is costly and we are happy anyway.  Soon I WILL be able to afford kids, but that will be because I am making efforts to improve my situation.  Also, I feel that we have learned a lot about fiscal responsibility because we have kids.\n\nNo one can know for certain before having kids what to expect. Even if you think you can afford kids now, you might not later and if you can't now you might be able to later.  Having kids is so much more important to society as a whole than one person's fiscal irresponsibility."

For instance, despite being a nation that has championed many freedoms, the US has seen a surge of anti-LGBTQ laws, with 70 enacted this year alone. This is part of a broader trend where anti-migrant sentiment is on the rise, and racial injustices, such as the disproportionate police violence against Black Americans, continue to be pressing issues. While the US has made strides in certain areas, it's crucial to recognize that it still faces significant challenges in achieving equality and nondiscrimination, as evidenced by its lower ranking in LGBTQ rights compared to other countries.",

The geopolitical landscape, heavily influenced by America's economic and military prowess, has allowed it to champion certain values on the international stage. Although this influence is sometimes seen as self-serving, the U.S. has undeniably contributed to the global dialogue on human rights, using its position to push for changes that align with its ideals.",

For many, the promise of human rights doesn't always align with the lived reality in America, where systemic issues and policies sometimes reflect a lack of concern for human beings.

Wars create significant barriers to development, and the U.S. has been fortunate to avoid many of these conflicts on its own soil, allowing it to focus on progress and innovation. This stability has enabled the U.S. to contribute significantly to the global human rights movement, setting standards and advocating for freedoms that many around the world aspire to achieve."

I for one wouldn't really care if we just hanged a man who raped and murdered children or sent him in front of a firing squad instead of giving him a 'humane' and expensive lethal injection, but not everyone feels that way, and I'm willing to settle for the injection.)",

Some folks are surprised when the accused prefer life imprisonment over the death penalty, thinking that an immediate end might be more merciful than spending a lifetime in a \"shithole\" prison. But maybe it's because, for some, the hope or chance of redemption, or even the mere act of continuing to live, holds more value than the finality of death.

Just like we regulate cars and alcohol to ensure safety while acknowledging their societal benefits, legalizing drugs could allow us to implement rules and guidelines that maximize their positive impacts while minimizing risks.

This can foster a deeper sense of empathy and connection within communities, as people are more open to different perspectives and experiences. Plus, by bringing these substances out of the shadows and into a regulated framework, we can ensure safer use and reduce the stigma that often surrounds them."

Many children of religious people are not religious themselves and freedom from religion is a fundamental right equal to freedom of religion. It seems like wishful thinking at best to assume that the child of religious parents will necessarily be religious themselves, and so it seems like wishful thinking to assume that such a child would consent to a modification of their body based purely on religious grounds.\n\n----\n\nI also think that to suggest the idea that bodily autonomy is a \"Western ideal\" because some cultures modify their body at some point during their life is very silly and kinda patronizing.

The Canadian Paediatrics Society puts it well:\n\n[\u201cNeonatal circumcision is a contentious issue in Canada. The procedure often raises ethical and legal considerations, in part because it has lifelong consequences and is performed on a child who cannot give consent. Infants need a substitute decision maker \u2013 usually their parents \u2013 to act in their best interests. Yet the authority of substitute decision makers is not absolute. In most jurisdictions, **authority is limited only to interventions deemed to be medically necessary.** In cases in which medical necessity is not established or a proposed treatment is based on personal preference, interventions should be deferred until the individual concerned is able to make their own choices. With newborn circumcision, medical necessity has not been clearly established.\u201d](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)\n\nTo override someone's body autonomy rights the standard is medical necessity. Without necessity the decision goes to the patient themself, later in life. Circumcision is very far from being medically necessary.\n\nI can elaborate more on the AAP if you want. They have been roundly critiqued."

                    "While some argue that infant circumcision has positive medical benefits, such as improved hygiene, the actual statistics and medical literature suggest otherwise. For instance, the Canadian Paediatrics Society notes that a significant number of circumcisions would be required to prevent a single urinary tract infection, which can be treated effectively with antibiotics anyway. Similarly, the risk of conditions like balanoposthitis or HIV in infants is either minimal or irrelevant, and other less invasive treatments exist. Moreover, circumcision is not a medically necessary procedure, and performing it on infants who cannot consent raises ethical concerns. Instead of presenting it as a preventative measure, it should be a personal choice made when the individual is capable of informed consent.",
                    "While some argue that there are positive medical benefits to infant circumcision, it's important to consider that these benefits are often overstated and can be achieved through other non-invasive means. The risks associated with not being circumcised, like urinary tract infections, are rare and can be managed with proper hygiene and care. Moreover, the American Academy of Pediatrics stands largely alone in its support for circumcision, with many international medical professionals questioning the necessity and ethics of the procedure. The potential health benefits, such as reduced risk of certain infections, do not justify the permanent alteration of an infant's body when these issues can be addressed without surgery.",
                    "The notion that circumcision has positive medical benefits is largely a myth. Many argue that the supposed advantages are overstated and that the risks and ethical concerns far outweigh any potential benefits. Just like with Type 1a FGM, which is often cited as a direct analogue to circumcision, there's a growing consensus that there is no solid medical justification for the procedure. Most medical references suggest that the purported benefits are either negligible or can be achieved through less invasive means, making the practice unnecessary and outdated.",
                    "While some argue that infant circumcision offers certain medical benefits, such as a reduced risk of urinary tract infections and potentially lower rates of penile cancer, the statistics tell a different story. The numbers needed to prevent these conditions through circumcision are incredibly high, making it a questionable preventative measure. For instance, circumcising between 111 to 125 boys to prevent a single UTI, or up to 322,000 to prevent one case of penile cancer, hardly seems justifiable, especially when there are less invasive treatments available. Moreover, the foreskin plays a crucial role in sexual pleasure, and its removal can potentially decrease sensitivity and enjoyment for both the individual and their partner. Ultimately, the supposed medical benefits do not outweigh the ethical concerns and the importance of bodily autonomy.",
                    "While some argue that there are positive medical benefits to infant circumcision, a closer look at the data suggests otherwise. According to the Canadian Paediatrics Society, the medical advantages often cited, such as reduced risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and penile cancer, are statistically insignificant when weighed against the number of procedures needed to prevent a single case. For instance, 111 to 125 infant boys would need to be circumcised to prevent just one UTI, which can be easily treated with antibiotics. Similarly, the risk of penile cancer is so low that the number needed to circumcise to prevent just one case ranges from 900 to 322,000. These figures highlight that alternative treatments or preventive measures are not only more effective but also less invasive. Furthermore, the ethical considerations cannot be ignored; the procedure is performed on individuals who cannot consent, and medical necessity has not been clearly established. Ultimately, the decision to undergo circumcision should be left to the individual when they can make an informed choice, respecting their bodily autonomy."

[Legislation appears to be one of the primary factors that influences intent to perform FGM on their daughters among immigrants who come from countries where FGM is practiced](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11121382/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#sec3-ijerph-21-00528).\n\nEven outside the context of a ban, we need to consider what would actually be the consequences of not circumcising a child even if, technically speaking, it is a cultural requirement. Who would even know whether the child is circumcised? For secular Jewish people, I suspect very few people outside the family would know, so would this really cause \"deculturation?\" I'm sure it would become more impactful towards the more religious end of the spectrum, so here you need to consider the specific cultural context to evaluate the benefit of being protected against \"deculturation.\"",
                    "This discussion comes across as intensely American. Circumcision is much less common outside the US and North Africa.\n\n\nI am extremely anti-circumcision. It has been my experience that women tend to defer to their partner, and circumcised men are very resistant to the idea that it's wrong to circumcise an infant.\n\n\n\nThe strongest predictor for a male child to be circumcised is whether his father is. None of my male family members are circumcised (except for a cousin who was circumcised as a teenager as treatment for phimosis). I once fought with a high school boyfriend because I told him I'd never consider circumcision for an infant and he insisted he'd want his son to \"match\" - we broke up shortly after. I prefer to date uncircumcised men.\n\n\nI agree with you that male circumcision is genital mutilation and very bad. But it's driven by cultural mores around masculinity and religion way more than female preference. This also applies to FGM - older women tend to be the ones preserving the practice.",
                    "People often say male circumcision shouldn't be banned because it's a religious and cultural thing that argument falls apart when you consider fgm is a religious and cultural thing yet that's banned",
                    "Yeah I think it depends, but there are some American gentile populations where circumcision is universal. I actually wasn\u2019t raised Jewish- my mom is Irish Catholic and my dad is Jewish- but circumcision is equally as common among Irish Catholics in the U.S. as Jews, so my being circumcised wasn\u2019t ever a discussion. All of my male relatives, be them Irish or Jewish-American, were circumcised at birth. It\u2019s a cultural norm for both groups.",

                    "Circumcision is the cultural norm in some societies or groups of people, but the idea that banning it would lead to the \"deculturation\" of a child seems overstated. While it's true that for some Jewish and Muslim communities, circumcision holds religious significance, the actual impact of a ban might not be as drastic as some fear. Many people might simply adapt by raising their children within their cultural and religious traditions without circumcision. Just as legislation has influenced practices like FGM among immigrant populations, a ban on infant circumcision could lead to a cultural shift rather than a loss of cultural identity. Ultimately, the child's integration into their family's culture could remain largely unaffected, as other cultural practices and beliefs would still be passed down.",
                    "Circumcision is deeply embedded in the cultural norms of certain societies, particularly in the United States and parts of North Africa, where it's more common than in other parts of the world. This practice is often perpetuated by the idea that a son should \"match\" his father, leading to a cycle where circumcised men are resistant to questioning the practice. It's not uncommon to see women defer to their partner's preference on this issue, which often aligns with their own cultural upbringing. Despite the growing awareness of circumcision as a form of genital mutilation, cultural beliefs around masculinity and religion continue to drive its prevalence, similar to how older generations uphold practices like female genital mutilation in some cultures.",
                    "People often argue that male circumcision shouldn't be banned because it's a religious and cultural tradition. However, this reasoning doesn't hold up when you consider that female genital mutilation (FGM), which is also rooted in religious and cultural practices, is banned in many places due to its harmful effects. Just because something is a cultural norm doesn't mean it's exempt from scrutiny or that it should continue unchallenged. We should be questioning and re-evaluating these practices, especially when they involve infants who can't consent to such permanent changes to their bodies.",
                    "Circumcision is deeply ingrained in certain cultural norms, especially in some American communities where it's almost universal. For instance, even outside of Jewish traditions, many Irish Catholic families in the U.S. also follow this practice. It's so common that it's often not even up for debate; it\u2019s just something that\u2019s done. This widespread acceptance across different backgrounds highlights how circumcision has become a cultural norm in various groups, regardless of religious affiliations.",
                    "Circumcision is deeply rooted in the cultural practices of certain societies, where it's often seen as a rite of passage or a tradition that's been passed down through generations. However, as OP highlights, the concept of \"mutilation\" is subjective and largely influenced by cultural norms. While some view circumcision as a standard medical procedure, others argue that it's an unnecessary intervention imposed on infants who can't consent. It's important to recognize that what one culture deems normal, another might see as a violation of bodily autonomy."

Parents with strong religious motivations might still seek out circumcision through illegal means, potentially putting their children at greater risk.

Removing this revenue stream would mean hospitals lose out on a significant source of income, which is why there might be resistance to banning it.",

Most parents only opt for it because it's presented as an option, and doctors don't usually highlight its drawbacks. If medical professionals started saying they don't perform circumcisions on babies anymore because it's not a beneficial procedure, it's unlikely parents would seek it out elsewhere. Sure, some religious communities might still want it, but banning it outright isn't really feasible due to those cultural considerations. In reality, hospitals wouldn't be losing out on much revenue if circumcision was banned, as it's not a major source of income in the first place.",

Hospitals might see it as a cash cow, but that's not a good enough reason to put a baby through an unnecessary procedure. It's about time we stop treating circumcision as a routine practice and recognize it for what it is: an elective surgery without a medical basis, which means it shouldn't be happening just to pad hospital profits."

                    "It's true that kids without smartphones might get bullied by their classmates, but isn't it more about how parents handle the situation rather than just blaming the teachers? Parents play a crucial role in guiding their kids on how to handle peer pressure and teaching them that self-worth isn't tied to owning the latest gadget. Instead of just giving in and buying a smartphone, parents could focus on building their child's confidence and resilience. It's about creating an environment where kids feel valued for who they are, not what they own.",
                    "Children without smartphones are likely to be bullied by their classmates because, in today's digital age, being constantly connected is seen as the norm. Kids who can't text during school hours or respond instantly might be seen as outsiders or less popular, leading to social isolation. It's not just about missing out on conversations; it's about missing the chance to fit in with peers. A good parental figure should recognize the social pressures that come with owning a smartphone and find a balance that ensures their child isn't left out or reprimanded for not being able to engage like their classmates."

You\u2019re being asked to create a legal personhood for purposes of having a right to be protected from murder but not a legal personhood entitled to the benefits of being a person. Obviously that makes no sense in fact or in law.\n\nTo the extent benefits would be extended to that person, we\u2019d have to look at benefits that accrue to minors since these people are essentially declaring an embryo to be a six week old person. This person must have an identity, including citizenship, and all the rights guaranteed by the U.S. constitution to all humans regardless of nationality, plus all rights guaranteed to U.S. citizens since it\u2019s very unlikely that any other country would identify an embryo as a person. This includes the right to legal advocacy for their own interests, including when those interests conflict with those of the parent (enjoy the case where lawyers argue whether the mother or the embryo should live when only one can survive the pregnancy).\n\nWhat you can\u2019t create, legally, is a person with only some rights like the right to not be murdered. The embryos are either people, in which case they have all the rights people have and it\u2019s illegal to kill them, or they\u2019re embryos whose demise carries the same ethical weight as removing a mole.\n\nThe answer is free to debate (I guess, in the sense that you have science on one side and theocracy on the other) but the only answer that is completely intellectually inconsistent is the position laid out in the original post, where embryos are some sub class of human that only gets some of the inalienable rights guaranteed by law.",

You can't just pick and choose which rights to give; it's all or nothing.

While some argue for legal protections for a fetus, it's crucial to consider that the embryo is part of the woman's body and life, and thus, she should have the autonomy to make decisions about it. It raises the question of whether the state should intervene or if the decision should rest solely with the parents, who are directly affected by the pregnancy."

I am happy to get the chance to vaccinate my 8 year old, but watching the situation in Israel has made me realize that we can't vaccinate our way out of this problem. \n\nHere are things we need to keep in mind regarding the vaccine.\n\n* The vaccine is effective at preventing death\n* The vaccine is effective at preventing hospitalization\n* The vaccine is only marginally effective at preventing infection. ([39% in Israel study](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/delta-variant-pfizer-covid-vaccine-39percent-effective-in-israel-prevents-severe-illness.html))\n\nIf we do mass vaccination with a vaccine that only prevents infection at best 40-60% of the time in the middle of a pandemic, what ends up happening is that a portion of vaccinated individuals end up getting infected either with mild symptoms, or asymptomatic. (This is why Israel, after their vaccination program, [literally had the largest number of cases in a day on September 14th, 2021](https://www.google.com/search?q=israel+covid+cases&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS570US570&oq=isr&aqs=chrome.0.69i59l3j69i57j69i65j69i60l2j69i61.4895j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).) \n\nOn the plus side, the vaccination means that these people are much less likely to be hospitalized or die, on the negative side however, as more and more individuals are infected, it is just a matter of time before we create a variant of the virus that is antibody resistant. ([Mu over 7 times more resistant to antibodies than first virus strain](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14439244)) Then the cycle starts all over again, and as we battle these new strains who pays the price? The elderly and those with comorbidities, the very people we are trying to protect.\n\nI read an article by a scientist recently that made the point: \"When vaccines work, but are not perfect, and you massively deploy them in the heat of a furious (Delta!) pandemic, then you\u2019re in really deep trouble.\" Note, he is not anti-vax, he knows vaccines work. What he is saying is that the deployment is the issue. We are spinning our wheels right now, and our current strategy won't work long term. \n\nThe eventual goal is to get the COVID numbers down very low, then vaccinate seasonly the way we do for flu. This means we are going to have to do several things effectively before we get this under control- \n\n* Get people access to rapid testing at home\n* Continue to work on early treatment for COVID to reduce mortality\n* Continue to mask up, social distance, and do whatever we can to reduce the spread\n* Use the vaccine for the most vulnerable among us.\n\nThe science is saying that we can't vaccinate our way out of this, that we are going to have to approach this differently, but the officials haven't caught up yet. Mass vaccination is not the longterm solution. **Vaccines work and we need to use them**, but mass vaccination will not work in the long run, so we need to change our approach.\n\nIt is a hard pill to swallow, as I said I am pro-vaccine, pro-mask, pro-social distancing. But I am also pro good science, and the science is telling us that we need to change our approach. Mass vaccination won't get us there.",

This means that even with mass vaccination, we still see cases rising, as evidenced by the situation in Israel where a high vaccination rate didn't prevent a spike in cases. However, the key benefit is that vaccinated individuals are far less likely to face severe outcomes, which is why making vaccines mandatory could help reduce the strain on healthcare systems and protect those at high risk. To truly control the pandemic, we need a multi-faceted approach that includes vaccines, rapid testing, early treatment, and continued public health measures like masking and social distancing.

It's a slippery slope where the line between public safety and personal autonomy becomes blurred, and we must be cautious about how much power we hand over to the state in the name of health.

You don't escape punishment for your misdeeds in life just because you 'have faith'. THAT was an invention (apparently of Paul).\n* 4: after judgment: the 'truly wicked' are annihilated: They 'cease to exist'. They are not \"punished for the rest of eternity. (That view is not supported by anything in the bible outside of 'revelation' (and even that is pretty thin)\n* 5: after judgment: everyone else goes to \"Olam Ha'Bah\" (aka \"the world to come\"; \"gan eden\" or \"the Garden of Eden). - This did NOT require belief in or worship of \"YHWH\" it was based on whether you were a decent person in life; not \"blind faith\". \n\noutside of 'revelation\" The \"New Testament\" does not refer to this concept of 'eternal punishment' at all. not once, not anywhere. It is ONLY mentioned in the \"Book of Revelation\" (aka \"The Apocalypse of John\") and even those references are pretty flimsy evidence. \n\nevery \"New Testament\" reference to \"Hell\" in modern translations are mistranslating one of three words. \u201cHades\u201d (which means \u201cthe grave\u201d and does not imply torment); \"Tartarus\" (which appears only one time in 2 Peter 2:4) and \"Gehenna\".\n\n* Tartarus is a specific reference to the pagan concept of the 'lowest level of hades'; The word \u201cTartarus\u201d is arguably the closest word used to this concept of eternal torment but this word is only used in one specific verse: 2 Peter 2:4 which is talking about a place where \"fallen angels\" are sent and is never mentioned as a destination for humans. - Also note that this same verse clearly limits the time spent in that place to \"until judgment\". \n\n* Gehenna is an actual physical place in Jerusalem, it was (in the first century CE) possibly a trash dump, garbage we know dead bodies were taken there and burned in a 'eternal fire' (a constantly burning fire that was always burning garbage). it was considered a \"cursed place\" due to legends about people sacrificing children there. It was mentioned in a lot of parables; often 'jesus' talking about wealthy people ending up in Gehenna (just like all the poor people). essentially saying that all their wealth doesn't save them from eventually dying and being thrown into the trash heap. - The parables did seem to imply that \u201cGehenna\u201d was some undesirable place but it\u2019s very dishonest to claim that the word literally translates to the common concept called \u201cHell\u201d. \n\nThe words translated into \u201cEternal Punishment\u201d in Matthew 25:46 (for instance) is also a mistranslation. The word they translate as \u201ceternal\u201d there is \u201c\u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd\u1fd0\u03bf\u03c2\u201d which is more correctly translated as \u201clasting for an age\u201d. If you note the same exact word is mistranslated to \u2018eternal\u2019 in modern translations of Jude 1:7 where Sodom and Gomorrah are supposedly destroyed by \u201ceternal fire\u201d - Those fires are clearly not burning today as we\u2019ve never found any such remnants anywhere on earth of this supposedly never ending fire. The other part of that phrase for \u201cPunishment\u201d is also a poor translation of \u201ckolasis\u201d which was an agricultural term basically meaning \u201ccut off\u201d or \u201cprune\u201d - possibly suggesting the concept where you \u201cprune away part of a plant and the rest of the plant gets stronger\u201d. It could possibly  refer to \u201cpunitive correction\u201d as opposed to some eternal torment or possibly it refers to being \u2018cut off from paradise/eternal life\u2019 which is effectively what happens when you cease to exist. - you aren\u2019t suffering but you are denied eternal life and entry to paradise \u2018for eternity\u2019 since you no longer exist.\n\nOutside of Revelation the most common thing people tend to bring up to support this 'eternal suffering in a lake of fire' nonsense is the story from Luke 16:19-31 of \"lazarus and rich man\". That parable however does not suggest \"eternal suffering\" at all.\n\n* 1: Abraham, Lazarus and \"Rich Man\" are all in the same place. - That already sounds a lot more like \"Sheol\" than \"Hell\". the claim that all of them talking to each other is clearly not a reference to one being \"in heaven\" and the other \"in hell\" since these places are always depicted as separate.\n\n* 2: \"Rich Man\" is suffering but... he's complaining about \"being thirsty\".... if he were burning in a lake of fire I think he'd have bigger problems than 'parched lips'.\n\n* 3: Nothing about that story says anything to suggest that the suffering is eternal; it only implies that \"Rich Man\" is suffering currently, not what his fate would be down the road. \n\nThen we have the claims from \"Revelation\":\n\n* 1: the [\"Second Death\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_death) is mentioned 4 times in this book; and described as the \"Death of the soul\"  \n\n* 2: Revelation 20:6 states that only people named in the \"book of life\" (those \"on the right\") receive \"eternal life\" - this gift of eternal life is ONLY for the righteous people that pass into paradise.\n\n* 3: Revelation 20:10 states that the 'beast', the 'false prophet' (aka the antichrist) and 'satan' are cast into the lake of fire where they will \"suffer for ever and ever\" - note that none of these entities are 'human'. \n\n* 4: then in Revelation 20:15 - the people who's name did not appear in the 'book of life' (those \"on the left\") are also cast into the same lake of fire where they \"suffer the second death\". - Note the different language... it does not say \"suffer for ever and ever\" but instead states that they \"suffer the second death\" - this suggests that their soul dies.. which is \"Annihilation\" not \"eternal suffering\". How can there be \"eternal suffering\" for people that do not have \"eternal life\"? - (see note 2 above).\n\nNothing about \"eternal suffering\" is consistent with anything in the bible. \"Eternal suffering\" is sadistic cruelty without any purpose or benefit. - It makes no rational sense if they are also trying to claim that 'god' is benevolent, loving, merciful etc. - Totally logically inconsistent with this view.\n\n>**John 2:2** \n>He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.\n\n>**Romans 5:18**\n>Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.\n\n>**Romans 11:29-32**\n> for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.\n> Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,\n> so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you.\n> For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.\n\n>**Titus 2:11**\n> For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.\n\nIn the early days of the christian church there were several competing views of the afterlife that are a lot more consistent with the rest of the bible: \n\n* \"Annihilation\" is the belief that \"after judgment\" the \"truly wicked\" are annihilated; they 'cease to exist' and that's it... no further suffering; they are gone. end of story. This is exactly what the Jewish traditional view of Sheol mentioned above taught and is logically consistent with the 'old testament'.\n\n* \"universal salvation\" or \"universalism\" is the belief that eventually everyone is saved. - This view treats suffering/punishment in the afterlife as reformative/corrective/judicial - meant to correct the recipient and is finite in duration - once you have atoned for your sins you get to move on to paradise with all the other people that ever lived. These were both pretty popular views in the early christian sects prior to ~425 CE;\n\nThe early christian sects disagreed considerably about which of these three views was 'correct'. \u201cBasil the Great\u201d specifically commented in ~370CE that the dominant view (of the time) was a belief in a limited purgatory, and others (such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, Didymus the blind, Diodore of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia wrote extensively about Universalism. There were some (mostly in Northern Africa around the coast of modern day Tunisia/Algeria) that were advocating the view of \u201cEternal Torment\u201d but it wasn't until 425CE that the church unified on this 'eternal suffering' doctrine (largely through the writings of Augustine of Hippo \u2013 who came to Rome from a city near what is now Annaba Tunisia).  This became the official version the church went with and the other views were deemed \"heretical\" and banned along with any early christian scriptures that supported those opposing views (such as the \"Apocalypse of Peter\").",

References to \"hell\" in the Old Testament are often mistranslations of \"Sheol,\" which is a temporary place where everyone, regardless of faith, awaits judgment. Similarly, the New Testament's mentions of \"Hades\" and \"Gehenna\" don't imply eternal torment. Instead, early Christian beliefs leaned towards concepts like \"annihilation\" or \"universal salvation,\" suggesting that eternal suffering was not the original intent. These interpretations are more consistent with a loving and merciful God, as they emphasize corrective justice and ultimate redemption rather than perpetual punishment.",

It's like blaming a computer program for errors when you're the one who wrote the code. As a software engineer, I don't get mad at my programs when they misbehave; I look for the mistakes I made and correct them.

It's hard to reconcile the notion of a loving deity with the idea that one mistake, even something as trivial as a personal act, could lead to eternal damnation.

It's like, come on, that's not the kind of love or mercy you'd expect from a divine being. Plus, the Bible itself mentions God being vengeful and jealous, which kind of makes you wonder about the whole \"God is love\" narrative.

                    "Homeschooling should be banned because it often creates a disconnect between families and the broader community, leading to significant social challenges for those who are homeschooled. From my experience at a community college, I've observed that many students who were homeschooled struggle with picking up on social cues, which can make it difficult for them to integrate into group settings or collaborate effectively with peers. While they might excel academically, their lack of exposure to diverse social environments during formative years often results in poor study habits and difficulties in working with others. Additionally, their limited social interactions can lead to unhealthy attachments and an inability to handle differing opinions, as they are not used to the diversity of thought and experience that comes with traditional schooling. Although there are exceptions, these patterns suggest that homeschooling can hinder the development of essential social skills needed to thrive in a community.",

It's just not fair to isolate kids like that and set them up for such a tough time in life. Being part of a community is crucial for personal development, and homeschooling can rob kids of that essential experience.",

This association can create a divide between families who homeschool and the broader community, fostering suspicion and misunderstanding. When families choose to homeschool, it can sometimes lead to isolation, cutting off valuable interactions and shared experiences with other families and community members. This isolation not only impacts the children\u2019s social development but also weakens the community fabric, as it limits the exchange of diverse ideas and values that typically come from a more integrated educational environment.",

Despite acknowledging issues with public schools, both families agreed that pulling kids out of the community would only lead to more harm than good. My dad had a memorable analogy, saying that kids and their faith are like Jello: the more you try to contain them by isolating them, the more they slip away. This kind of isolation can prevent kids from developing essential social skills and understanding diverse perspectives, ultimately harming their ability to integrate and contribute to society."

When you consider the vast majority of these homicides take place in certain metros, you really see those numbers drop even further to European-tier levels in certain states and regions, while others rival Brazil or Mexico's crime ridden areas.\n\nMass shootings are good television and the news loves to popularize them, but nobody can agree on their definition. \"Active Shooter Incidents\" are one way of categorizing it, but in 2022 there were 50 such incidents that saw 100 fatalities and 213 wounded: that averages out to 2 killed, 4 wounded in a mass shooting.\n\n2 killed, 4 wounded is not planet-shattering deaths considering most AR-15 armed mass shooters usually have enough bullets to kill 10 people and wound 20 in one 30rd magazine, so we have to assume that the average mass shooter is **wildly** incompetent at doing what they set out to do, with some [notable exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_shooting).\n\nDanger is a relative thing. I live in Upstate New York and can't tell you the last time I saw a firearm in public that wasn't a police officer's service weapon that I didn't go looking for at a gun store. If I continue not to look it is likely I will die before I see another. Other regions like the south where open carry is common (and the murder rate is dramatically higher) it's far more likely to see them, and be in danger from them.",

Every state requires its citizens to go take a test and be certified to drive their cars, and yet there are several states that do not require their citizens to obtain any kind of certifications to purchase, carry, and use firearms. My state of Texas is a very good example of this, there are practically no barriers at all. Like cars, guns are not inherently bad things, and have beneficial uses, but when in the hands of the wrong person, can be used for malicious purposes. There is also really nothing stopping people who live in heavily regulated states from attending things like gun shows in other places and purchasing firearms there. Without some kind of minimal universal system there will always be ways for people who should not be able to purchase a firearm to purchase a firearm.\n\nIt should be noted that most of the bad things that gun owners do (mass shootings, violent crime, etc.) are not due to the fact that they are gun owners, but rather direct products of socioeconomic and psychological factors. These problems need to be addressed, but are not things that can be solved overnight. It will take years if not decades to adequately provide remedies for these issues, and in the meantime a bandaid fix like increased gun control is not a bad idea. Of course this system should be simplified and reduced once these problems are reigned in to manageable levels, but until then, increased regulation is really the only way for us to minimize these side effects and allow us to concentrate on the real issues.\n\nThe sad part of all of this is though, is that as unpopular as gun control is (speaking in relative terms, I know a majority of Americans are in support of it), actually solving the root causes is even less popular. No one wants to see affordable housing, duplexes, or apartments in their nice neighborhoods, and yet, these are proved remedies to issues like poverty. Very few people, particularly men, in this country feel like mental health is an actual widespread issue and is something that needs to be addressed. So many people would rather brush these problems under the rug because they are massive and complex and difficult to effectively combat, but this in itself makes these issues worse.

Plus, the camaraderie and sense of purpose you get from working towards a common goal with others can be incredibly rewarding and fulfilling.",

It provides participants with essential life skills, such as teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving, which are invaluable in any career path. Moreover, it can be a transformative experience that broadens one's perspective, fosters a sense of civic duty, and creates a deeper connection to the community or nation as a whole.",

Doctors have access to significantly more potent drugs than marijuana because they have been shown to have beneficial uses in rigorously conducted studies. There are no such studies in favor of marijuana, and many against it's use.\n\nProponents of medical marijuana argue that there haven't been enough studies on marijuana because it is a schedule I drug, but a quick search for \"marijuana\" on PubMed yields 21,000 results. \"Cannabis\" yields 13,000 articles. Doctors and medical scientists have been studying cannabis for decades because top labs have access to it, it's widely used in the general population, and many other countries have done studies on it as well.

Despite this, they seemed to have jumped on this unfair limitation on doctors, and are quick to defend their right to administer this drug.\n\nThe twist is that doctors don't even want that drug. There are no professional organizations of doctors who are in favor of using medical marijuana. This includes political ones like the American Medical Association, and academic/regulatory ones like the American College of Physicians. \n\nThe fact is that in states where medical marijuana is legal, it is not being used by actual doctors who are trying to save patients lives. It functions as a front for drug users to get cannabis cards for things as benign as \"coughs\" and \"stomach aches.\" \n\nI think we should treat cannabis like we treat other recreational drugs like alcohol. But we shouldn't compromise the academic rigor of the field of medicine just because people like getting high. If a valid and well run randomized control trial finds that medical cannabis is actually beneficial in any way, doctors will be at the front of the pack in lobbying for it's use.

Glaucoma may also be helped by marijuana.\n\nThe examples you listed have never been proven in a real study. They might be true, but until someone shows real evidence of that, it's complete crap. Every single day there are people that claim that gluten causes cancer, vaccines cause autism, and that crushed rhino horns diluted in water can cure impotence. Medical marijuana is exactly the same. There is more evidence to support acupuncture than there is to support medical cannabis.\n\nFurthermore, there is the huge issue of bias in the few articles that do support medical cannabis. What if I said that there are ten new studies that show that using platelet enriched plasma can make athletes who get injured recover twice as fast? Sounds great, until you find out that all ten studies were done by people who were paid millions by the company that makes platelet enriched plasma. Think back to those examples of benefits that you listed. Did you read them in the New England Journal of Medicine? Or did you read them on a pro-cannabis website?\n\nThis is the fundamental problem with medical marijuana. If they did any of those things that you list, then how horrible would doctors have to be to keep it from patients? Maybe some are evil, but all of them? How stupid would they have to be not to sell one of the most profitable drugs ever? The guys who sell medical marijuana cards make bank. Are the rest of doctors just stupid? \n\nThe people who know the most about how disease work, namely doctors and biomedical scientists, all think medical marijuana is useless. They are actively researching it, but they aren't optimistic. The only people who are supportive are people who already use marijuana, and want an excuse to use it in the future.\n\nI sincerely hope that doctors find benefits to using pot because it would mean helping people who need it. But until they do, I simply can't support it from a medical perspective."

Cannabis has shown promise in managing chronic pain, reducing nausea in chemotherapy patients, and alleviating symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Critics often point to the lack of large-scale randomized control trials, but the restrictive classification of cannabis as a Schedule I drug has historically hindered research efforts. As more studies emerge, particularly from countries with more lenient cannabis laws, we're seeing a shift in the medical community's stance. Medical organizations may be slow to endorse cannabis due to historical biases and regulatory hurdles, but the anecdotal and preliminary scientific evidence suggests that cannabis can play a valuable role in modern medicine.",

People with conditions like MS have found immense relief using cannabis, especially when traditional pharmaceuticals fall short or come with a laundry list of side effects. It's also a game-changer for those undergoing chemo, as it helps combat nausea and loss of appetite, making it easier for patients to maintain their strength. Plus, cannabis could be a safer alternative to heavy-duty painkillers like morphine derivatives, which can be risky. And let's not forget its potential in helping with glaucoma. So while some folks might abuse medical marijuana, the benefits for those who truly need it are undeniable, and that's why it should be federally legalized.",

Cannabis is also known to help cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy by stimulating appetite and alleviating pain, which can be a game-changer in preventing wasting. Additionally, it offers a potentially safer alternative to opioids for pain management, which could help address the ongoing opioid crisis. While more rigorous studies are needed, these real-world experiences suggest that the medical community should take the potential of cannabis seriously."

When legal prices are way up there, a lot of people are just going to stick with their old dealers who can offer the same product for less. If the federal government steps in and legalizes cannabis across the board, they could regulate and lower these insane taxes, making the legal market more competitive. This would undercut the black market and organized crime, who thrive when prices in the legal market are too steep.",
                    "Legalizing cannabis in the U.S. didn't exactly dismantle the black market like some folks hoped. In places like Colorado, instead of cartels packing up and calling it a day, they just pivoted from selling cheap Mexican weed to pushing homegrown stuff on the sly. It's like they just shifted gears and kept on trucking, using the same networks and infrastructure to keep the black market alive. Plus, with the profits from illegal cannabis, some of these groups are diving into even nastier stuff, like heroin. So, while legalization has its upsides, it's not the silver bullet against organized crime that some people thought it would be."

Only 5% of lithium batteries get recycled, as of current statistics. \n2: lithium, like coal, is a finite resource. EVs are not a permanent environmental solution. \n3: newer cars produce significantly fewer tailpipe emissions than cars used to, and aren\u2019t actually as damaging as EV fans like to believe (not saying gas cars *aren\u2019t* damaging, just that EV crowd overhypes it). PM from tires is actually a huge emissions source, as well as carcinogenic. EVs on average weigh more than your average gas car. The weight of the battery and such contributes. That puts more pressure on the tires when braking and studies confirm EVs emit more PM via tires than many gas cars. \n4: lithium batteries don\u2019t last that long. Think of cell phones: 1 year of using your phone, and your phone doesn\u2019t hold a full charge as long as it did brand new. After 1 year of driving your EV, you\u2019re not going to get the range you used to before needing to recharge. You\u2019re going to be charging your EV more often, using electricity. Additionally, lithium batteries will need to be replaced more often than a gas car will need to be re-purchased.

For every ton of lithium extracted, about 15 tons of CO2 are emitted, and with only about 5% of these batteries being recycled, the environmental impact is substantial. Moreover, lithium is a finite resource, much like coal, which means electric vehicles (EVs) aren't a permanent solution to our environmental woes. While newer gas cars have become more efficient with lower tailpipe emissions, EVs, due to their heavier weight, contribute to increased particulate matter emissions from tires. This is a significant issue since EVs generally weigh more than traditional cars, putting extra pressure on tires and leading to higher emissions. Additionally, the longevity of lithium batteries is questionable; they degrade over time, much like the batteries in our smartphones. After just a year of use, an EV might not hold a charge as well, requiring more frequent recharges and eventually replacements, leading to more mining.

Characters like Spider-Man and Iron Man are more like us, grappling with personal struggles and everyday challenges. So, while Marvel nails the human aspect, DC's got that epic, legendary vibe down.",
                    "While Marvel might excel in creating memorable character moments, DC truly shines with its individual story arcs and character depth. DC has crafted some of the most iconic and complex characters in comic history, like Batman and Superman, whose stories often delve into profound themes and moral dilemmas. These characters aren't just superheroes; they're legends with rich backstories and intricate personal journeys. Marvel might nail the snappy dialogue and team dynamics, but when it comes to storytelling that resonates on a deeper level, DC's characters often lead the charge.",
                    "While Marvel might have the edge in cinematic success, there's a strong case to be made for DC having better characters overall. DC's comics have been iconic for decades, giving us deep, complex narratives and legendary arcs that have stood the test of time. Their villains, like the Joker and Lex Luthor, are not just baddies but intricate characters with depth and backstories that make them unforgettable. Plus, DC's TV shows and games often outshine their competitors, delivering compelling stories and engaging gameplay that keep fans hooked."

Developing a whole new constructed language from scratch is a massive undertaking and, honestly, doesn't give us much bang for our buck. We've already got languages like English that are widely spoken and understood across the globe, so why reinvent the wheel? Instead of pouring resources into constructing something entirely new, it makes more sense to just work with what we've got and focus on teaching and spreading an existing language. After all, the goal is to make communication easier, not more complicated!",

These languages come with rich histories, cultural contexts, and existing infrastructure, making them way easier to adopt on a global scale. Plus, people are already learning them as second languages, so why reinvent the wheel?"

Commutes are eliminated, saving precious time and reducing stress, while the flexibility of home offices allows for a more focused work environment. Why should employees give up these advantages when they're getting more done at home? It seems counterintuitive to force a return to the office when the current setup is working so well for productivity.",

Sure, some jobs require specific tools or setups that are only available in the office, like that one person who needs 15 buttons hooked up to their computer. But for those who can set up a similar environment at home, the lack of commute and the ability to create a personalized workspace can lead to getting more done in less time. Plus, without the usual office distractions, it's easier to focus and dive deep into tasks, making remote work a game-changer for productivity.",

It's ironic how companies initially praised employees for their stellar performance from home, yet now some are backtracking, claiming productivity is slipping without any solid evidence. The truth is, many of us find fewer distractions at home, allowing us to focus better and get more done in less time. Plus, without the daily commute, we can start the day fresh and energized, ready to tackle tasks efficiently. It's not about productivity suffering; it's about some managers craving control over their teams."

According to research, universal healthcare can lead to a healthier population, which in turn could reduce the overall economic burden of healthcare costs in the future. By investing in healthcare for all, we not only improve individual well-being but also create a more robust and productive society that could ultimately offset the initial costs.",
                    "Implementing universal healthcare in the US could lead to significant economic benefits by reducing overall healthcare spending. By transitioning to a system that expands and improves Medicare, we could save around $400 billion annually, as Medicare is known to be one of the most efficient healthcare systems with administrative costs at about 8%, compared to the 22% in the private sector. Furthermore, reducing the exorbitant $100 billion that Big Pharma spends on sales and marketing could be another area where cost savings are realized. In the long run, universal healthcare not only promises a healthier populace but also a more economically sound nation, as healthier individuals contribute more effectively to the economy.",

Imagine a future where everyone is insured, supported by a universal basic income, and living in innovative urban spaces with clinics on-site. This isn't just about health; it's about creating a society where everyone has the chance to thrive. Access to healthcare, like free teletherapy, could save lives, allowing people to get the help they need without financial barriers. Here's hoping more leaders see the light and push for these necessary changes.",

By ensuring everyone has access to basic healthcare, we're not just doing the right thing morally, but we're also investing in a more productive and economically stable society.

The current profit-driven healthcare system often overlooks the needs of the underprivileged because there's no financial incentive to help those who can't pay. By treating healthcare as a public health issue with a holistic approach, we can ensure that resources are allocated to benefit everyone, not just those who can afford it, and this shift could potentially be the key to overcoming the cultural and political hurdles that currently impede progress."

                    "Universalizing healthcare reduces social inequalities because it addresses fundamental issues like homelessness, which is inherently a healthcare problem. When a state prioritizes healthcare for all, as some governors have successfully campaigned for, it can significantly improve individual lives and community well-being. However, the reality is that many still find themselves without shelter and proper care, living under bridges and by rivers. By ensuring everyone is insured, and coupling this with initiatives like universal basic income and innovative urban housing solutions, we can create a society where everyone has access to essential services, including mental health support, which could save lives.",

By providing healthcare for all, we can address the growing gap between the rich and the poor, ensuring that everyone has a fair chance at a healthy life. It's about fulfilling the promise of providing for the common welfare, ensuring that no one is left behind due to their financial situation.",
                    "Universalizing healthcare is a crucial step in reducing social inequalities because it shifts the focus from profit-driven motives to a more holistic, systems-thinking approach that benefits everyone. In a privatized healthcare system, there's little incentive for companies to invest in the well-being of marginalized communities, as profit margins often take precedence over public health. By making healthcare a fundamental right, the government can ensure that resources are allocated to those who need them most, regardless of their socio-economic status. However, implementing such a system requires navigating the complex political and cultural landscape, which can be challenging, but it's essential for creating a more equitable society.",
                    "Universalizing healthcare can significantly reduce social inequalities by ensuring that everyone, regardless of their income or social status, has access to necessary medical services. In countries without universal healthcare, those with lower incomes often face barriers to accessing even basic medical care, which exacerbates existing inequalities. When everyone has the same right to healthcare, it levels the playing field, allowing people to focus on improving other aspects of their lives without the constant worry of medical expenses. This approach not only promotes equality but also contributes to a healthier, more productive society as a whole."

People often fear that if healthcare is a guaranteed right, it could discourage innovation and efficiency in the medical field, as there might be less incentive to improve services when everyone is entitled to the same basic level of care.

They often argue that when healthcare is provided as a right, it could result in longer wait times and a strain on medical professionals, ultimately lowering the standard of care. Additionally, there's a belief that individuals should take personal responsibility for their health expenses, and that a universal system might reduce incentives for people to work harder to afford their own insurance."

The leave campaign's arguments about reclaiming control resonated with many who felt that EU membership diluted their country's autonomy. This sentiment has emboldened similar movements across Europe, where parties are increasingly questioning the benefits of EU membership and advocating for more national control.

Many European nations, like Poland with its staunchly anti-immigrant stance, and even Spain and the Netherlands with their troubling instances of racism in sports and cultural practices, have seen a rise in right-wing populism.

With France being one of the EU's largest member states, it's no surprise that the FN has secured a high number of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). This trend illustrates how Brexit has emboldened nationalist sentiments, encouraging similar movements in other countries to push for their own versions of independence or increased autonomy from the EU."

If public transport relies on government funding, which ultimately means taxpayers' money, to cover routine operating costs then it becomes extremely vulnerable to defunding by the government of the day.

By contrast if public transport can be commercially viable with, perhaps not no subsidy but at least not an enormous one, then it's less subject to the whims of politicians.\n\nWhat's really needed is pricing private motoring to reflect its true costs.

Local councils have a ton of responsibilities but limited ways to raise funds, often relying on local taxes and pleading with the central government for more money. This setup makes it tough for councils to manage transport effectively. For instance, while state highways and road policing are funded centrally, councils have to cover costs like transit ticket inspectors and security staff from their own limited budgets. If public transport falls under the public sector, it stands to reason that the necessary funding could be reallocated from existing public services, potentially easing the financial burden on local councils.",

However, the reliance on government funding does pose risks, as it can become a target for budget cuts, especially when voters prioritize tax reductions. To mitigate these risks, it's crucial to address the true costs of private motoring, which often remain hidden due to fixed costs like ownership, making driving seem cheaper per mile. By adjusting these costs to reflect the real impact of car usage, we can encourage a shift towards more sustainable public transport solutions, reducing the pressure on government budgets and ensuring consistent funding.",
                    "Sure, public transport might not be \"free\" in the sense that it costs nothing, but if it's managed by the public sector, the funding can be more efficiently sourced from existing public services. Think about it: instead of everyone individually paying for transport, the costs are pooled and covered by taxes, which can be more equitable. It\u2019s like how we fund public schools or libraries \u2013 everyone chips in a little bit, and everyone benefits. Plus, it can lead to better accessibility and less congestion, which is a win for society as a whole.",

Without the pressure to turn a profit, public transport could focus on accessibility and reliability, ensuring everyone has a fair shot at getting where they need to go.

While both male and female restrooms can be gross, the separation often means that the mess is more predictable and manageable for users. This predictability and the ability to avoid certain types of messes make gender-segregated bathrooms a preferred choice for many, keeping the experience just a little bit more bearable.",

Some folks suggest having three options: one for both genders and separate ones for each gender, which seems like a decent compromise. After all, not everyone feels comfortable sharing such a personal space with the opposite gender, and some don't even feel at ease with their own.

Gender-neutral bathrooms could offer a more inclusive environment, allowing everyone to feel comfortable regardless of their gender identity.

The notion of a grown man sharing a bathroom with a female child is unsettling for many, unless specific circumstances, like a father accompanying his young daughter, are in play. One compromise could be implementing gender-neutral toilet stalls, which provide privacy while addressing inclusivity. However, the concept of extending this to shared gender-neutral changing rooms raises further questions about privacy and comfort that society is still grappling with.",

This setup respects individual privacy and can be more inclusive for everyone, regardless of gender identity. Multi-person bathrooms might be a different story due to privacy concerns, but for single-user facilities, going gender-neutral seems like a no-brainer."

It's crucial to understand that this system, while effective in many ways, can also foster an environment where greed becomes a primary motivator, overshadowing communal well-being and ethical business practices. Rereading and reflecting on these dynamics can offer a clearer picture of both the benefits and pitfalls of capitalism.",
                    "Capitalism inherently encourages greed because its foundational mechanisms drive individuals to prioritize self-interest and accumulation of wealth over communal well-being. This system naturally trends towards consolidation and exploitation, as people are incentivized to maximize their gains, often at the expense of others. It's not just a matter of a few bad actors abusing the system; rather, the system itself is designed in a way that rewards such behavior. In a capitalist society, the fear of scarcity compels individuals to hoard resources, believing that if they don\u2019t seize opportunities now, someone else will, leaving them with nothing. This lack of trust and the competitive drive to \"get theirs\" first is what perpetuates the cycle of greed. If we were more honest about these built-in flaws, we could work towards mitigating the negative impacts and fostering a more equitable society.",
                    "Capitalism, at its core, is supposed to drive innovation and reward hard work, but somewhere along the way, it seems to have taken a turn towards rewarding greed. The idea was that competition would keep everything in check, but instead, it often feels like the rich just keep getting richer while the rest of us are left to fend for ourselves. If capitalism was truly as self-correcting as it's claimed to be, you'd think it would've found a way to curb the excesses and inequalities that have become so rampant. It's like the system is rigged to favor those at the top, and instead of promoting fair play, it just fuels a never-ending cycle of greed and exploitation.",
                    "While capitalism has its merits, it's crucial to remember that it often prioritizes profit over people, leading to a system where greed can thrive unchecked. The drive for constant growth and profit maximization means that big corporations sometimes put their own interests ahead of the well-being of individuals. As consumers and workers, we can find ourselves in a system that's more about the bottom line than our personal needs or rights. So, even if you support the capitalist framework, it's important to stay aware of how it can sometimes work against the very people it's supposed to serve."

If that statement is true despite someone having the opinion that torturing babies is actually really awesome, then that would be an example of an objectively true moral statement.\n\n---\n\n>So if you're going to say it's \"an objective moral law,\" you have to explain how a rule is an objective fact, because \"rule\" and \"fact\" are two ENTIRELY different concepts.\n\nI've never heard anyone say \"moral law\" outside highly religious contexts but I think what you're asking for in a moral general sense is some reason to believe that there exists at least one objectively true moral statement. The **Partners in Crime** argument is a pretty strong argument for an objective moral statement, and it has nothing to do with religion or God to boot!\n\nAs an atheist, I presume you think there are objectively better and objectively worse ways of acquiring knowledge: I'm going to take a guess here and say you will agree that reading tea leaves and using divine revelation as means of acquiring knowledge are worse than using the scientific method. That is, science is preferential to the truth over reading the bible and thus scientific inquiry is better at discovering new truths than studying holy texts and it doesn't matter how many people believe in the *Bible* or the *Bhagavad Gita*. This is an example of an objectively true normative statement (specifically an epistemic statement): an objectively true statement that is about whether or not one thing is \"preferential\" or \"better\" than another thing.\n\nNow let's consider a world in which morality is subjective. For any moral statement, that statement's truth is contingent on our feelings towards it. Thus, all statements of the form \"X is better than Y\" are necessarily subject to whether people believe \"X is better than Y\". So there must be some argument that, if pitted against the statement \"X is better than Y independent of peoples' opinion\", it will always defeat it and show it to be false. There's a problem here though, because for any argument we can muster of this nature, it looks like it will be equally effective against the epistemic statements that we agreed were objectively true before. So, if we think there exists this argument which can be used against any claim of objective moral truth then it should also successfully argue that science is only better at acquiring knowledge than biblical studies if people believe it to be true. This is clearly false, thus this argument cannot exist and there must exist at least one objectively true moral statment.\n\nIf you wanted to attack this argument, you will need to find some sort of substantive distinction between epistemic claims and moral claims. That is, some reason to suspect that any reason one could give for saying \"X is better than Y\" must be subjective cannot also be used to suggest that a similar claim of \"X is better at acquiring knowledge than Y\" must also be subjective. Personally, I don't think any such argument exists which is why I side with the moral realists (those that say there exist objective moral statements) despite being an atheist."

Until you do this, your claim is unsubstantiated. \n\nYour proposal seems to go like this. Morality concerns how things ought to be. *How things ought to be is, by definition, a matter of preference*. Preferences are subjective. So morality is subjective.\n\nBut the bit I\u2019ve italicised is just not true! All you\u2019ve done to support it is point to the fact-value distinction, but all this distinction tells us is that there is a fundamental divide between statements about what is the case and statements about what ought to be the case. The definition of \u201cvalue\u201d here doesn\u2019t all by itself tell us whether it\u2019s subjective or objective. \n\nSecond, to rebut your thesis, it only needs to be shown that it\u2019s *possible* for morality to be objective, not that it\u2019s *actually* objective.

If that statement is true despite someone having the opinion that torturing babies is actually really awesome, then that would be an example of an objectively true moral statement.\n\n---\n\n>So if you're going to say it's \"an objective moral law,\" you have to explain how a rule is an objective fact, because \"rule\" and \"fact\" are two ENTIRELY different concepts.\n\nI've never heard anyone say \"moral law\" outside highly religious contexts but I think what you're asking for in a moral general sense is some reason to believe that there exists at least one objectively true moral statement. The **Partners in Crime** argument is a pretty strong argument for an objective moral statement, and it has nothing to do with religion or God to boot!\n\nAs an atheist, I presume you think there are objectively better and objectively worse ways of acquiring knowledge: I'm going to take a guess here and say you will agree that reading tea leaves and using divine revelation as means of acquiring knowledge are worse than using the scientific method. That is, science is preferential to the truth over reading the bible and thus scientific inquiry is better at discovering new truths than studying holy texts and it doesn't matter how many people believe in the *Bible* or the *Bhagavad Gita*. This is an example of an objectively true normative statement (specifically an epistemic statement): an objectively true statement that is about whether or not one thing is \"preferential\" or \"better\" than another thing.\n\nNow let's consider a world in which morality is subjective. For any moral statement, that statement's truth is contingent on our feelings towards it. Thus, all statements of the form \"X is better than Y\" are necessarily subject to whether people believe \"X is better than Y\". So there must be some argument that, if pitted against the statement \"X is better than Y independent of peoples' opinion\", it will always defeat it and show it to be false. There's a problem here though, because for any argument we can muster of this nature, it looks like it will be equally effective against the epistemic statements that we agreed were objectively true before. So, if we think there exists this argument which can be used against any claim of objective moral truth then it should also successfully argue that science is only better at acquiring knowledge than biblical studies if people believe it to be true. This is clearly false, thus this argument cannot exist and there must exist at least one objectively true moral statment.\n\nIf you wanted to attack this argument, you will need to find some sort of substantive distinction between epistemic claims and moral claims. That is, some reason to suspect that any reason one could give for saying \"X is better than Y\" must be subjective cannot also be used to suggest that a similar claim of \"X is better at acquiring knowledge than Y\" must also be subjective.

Nobody has to \"believe\" anything for the broadly applied scientific method to be more effective at acquiring knowledge than studying one single book.\n\nPeople argue subjective points all the time.  Whether an argument is effective is contingent upon so many factors - including the person making the argument, the receipient, how sound the argument is, the emotional state of both parties, etc etc.\n\n> If you wanted to attack this argument, you will need to find some sort of substantive distinction between epistemic claims and moral claims.\n\nEpistemic claims are about how we know things, while moral claims are about preferred modes of behavior.\n\n>  That is, some reason to suspect that any reason one could give for saying \"X is better than Y\" must be subjective cannot also be used to suggest that a similar claim of \"X is better at acquiring knowledge than Y\" must also be subjective.\n\n\"Better\" does not mean \"more effective than.\"  I already said that something can be objectively more effective at a particular thing than something else.  That doesn't mean moral claims about how it is preferred one behave are objective.  To say \"You should do what is most effective\" is a subjective claim.  So is \"You should do what is least effective.\"\n\n> Personally, I don't think any such argument exists which is why I side with the moral realists (those that say there exist objective moral statements) despite being an atheist.\n\nAnd moral realism is at it's core incoherent, which is why I'm requesting somebody explain a coherent model of how morality could be objective, and even after all these comments, nobody has.  They've just said \"Well, if we define morality as a general concept to mean my specific standard of morality, then it would be objective.\"  Sure.  And if we redefine \"chameleon\" then it would be a mammal. I want to know how any type of preferred thing could be objective, because that seems to me to be an incoherent proposition, and everyone who is arguing in favor of it is just further solidifying my understanding that it is.",

                    "Sure, moral relativism and subjective morality are often used interchangeably, but they do have their distinctions. Moral subjectivism suggests that moral judgments are based on individual feelings and perspectives, while moral relativism might consider cultural or societal norms as the basis for morality. However, both concepts share a common thread: they avoid the heavy ontological baggage that comes with asserting objective moral truths. By applying Occam's razor, which advises us to favor simpler theories with fewer assumptions, moral subjectivism stands out as the more straightforward and preferable approach. It allows us to navigate moral discussions without the need to prove the existence of universal moral facts, which can be a daunting and contentious task.",
                    "Moral subjectivism, by its nature, assumes less about the existence of universal moral truths compared to moral objectivism. This simplicity aligns with Occam's razor, which suggests that the theory making the fewest assumptions is often preferable. Just because morality is subjective doesn't mean everything else is too; it's about recognizing that moral truths aren't necessarily universal. By embracing subjectivism, we're not saying that all aspects of reality are subjective, just that moral judgments don't require an overarching objective framework to be meaningful.",
                    "When it comes to the debate between moral subjectivism and moral objectivism, it's crucial to recognize that moral subjectivism makes fewer ontological assumptions. By acknowledging that some morals are subjective, we open the door to a more flexible understanding of ethics that aligns with Occam's razor. This principle suggests that the simplest explanation, which in this case involves fewer assumptions, is often preferable. While moral realism presents a compelling argument, claiming all morals are subjective remains an opinion, as it acknowledges the complexity and variability of human ethics without overcomplicating the philosophical landscape.",
                    "Moral subjectivism makes fewer ontological assumptions than moral objectivism, which aligns with the principle of Occam's razor, suggesting that the simpler explanation is preferable. When we talk about morality being objective, we're implying that moral truths exist independently of human opinions or beliefs, akin to how scientific facts exist irrespective of our understanding. However, the idea of objective morality seems incoherent because preferences, by nature, require a mind to exist. Just as a rock doesn't have a favorite color, moral preferences without a mind don't make sense. In subjective morality, moral claims don't have truth values like objective claims do; they're contingent on individual or societal perspectives, which makes them inherently subjective and resistant to being proven true or false in an absolute sense.",
                    "While it's true that some aspects of morality can be seen as objective, like basic principles of fairness or harm, there's also a significant subjective element influenced by culture, personal experiences, and societal norms. Moral subjectivism, by acknowledging this complexity, makes fewer ontological assumptions than moral objectivism, which often requires a universal moral law or truth. By applying Occam's razor, which suggests that the simplest explanation with the fewest assumptions is usually preferable, moral subjectivism stands out as a more straightforward approach. It embraces the nuanced nature of human morality without overcomplicating it with unnecessary universal claims."

This geographic reality places the majority of Turkey's landmass outside the traditional boundaries of Europe. Therefore, when considering Turkey's potential membership in the European Union, it's crucial to acknowledge that its geographical identity is predominantly Asian rather than European. This distinction can play a significant role in discussions about cultural, economic, and political integration with the EU.",

It's a political and economic union, and there are already countries like Cyprus, which is geographically in West Asia, that are part of the EU. Turkey's unique position straddling both Europe and Asia gives it a rich cultural and historical connection to both continents. Plus, many countries that are geographically European, like Norway and Switzerland, aren't even in the EU, so geography isn't the be-all and end-all. Turkey has deep ties with European countries and a long history of engagement with Europe, making it a strong candidate for EU membership despite its geographic position.",

However, being partly in Europe doesn't automatically qualify a country for EU membership. The European Union considers a range of factors, including political, economic, and cultural alignment, beyond mere geography.

They were the ones who alluded the turkish people with ascension in the eu while literally everyone invested in geopolitics knew at the time that wouldnt ever happen. It was too much of a loss of political power for France and Germany, not even mentioning the hardships it would bring giving 80 million fairly poor people free movement into Europe. Europe also didnt stand behind Turkey when they downed a russian plane for intrusion. When the coup happened, Putin was the first to stand behind Turkey while the West didnt even opened their mouths. They also failed to even pay the money from the immigrants deal, which brought on a lot of hardships on the turkish people that they still deal with I must remind you. Why should the turkish leadership or people must stand behind an organization that wont stand behind them ?\n\n>I mean Turkey illegally occupies half of Cyprus, an EU member\n\nTurkey didnt occupied an EU member is the important distinction here to make. Cyprus was already divided by the time they joined. The border conflict already violated the EU criterias and the only reason they got in was the blackmail from Greece forcing Eu's hand. This is also one of the reasons why EU wont become something greater as it is in my opinion. As soon as you give every individual country a full-veto power instead of deciding on a certain threshold, you get an organization which cant ever take a meaningful action. Much like the Alien-X from Ben10.(I know its a random and out of nowhere comparison but I liked it lmao)\n\n>has pretty questionable claims over eastern med\n\nThis is a fair point however nowhere near enough to cause such a rift between 2 entities. The claims were never about EEZ or Kastellorizo. They were all about the gas in the mediterranian and the connection between Libya and Turkey. Its basically goverments trying to one-up each other. Looking back on previous court cases  Turkey could have easily won a favoruibly result at their case with Kastellorizo, however that would mean it would have to give up the claims on the gas and the connection to Libya.

The EU's past promises of ascension dangled before Turkey have bred a sense of disillusionment, as many in Turkey feel that Europe has repeatedly failed to support them, whether in geopolitical conflicts or financial agreements, such as the migrant deal. This history of perceived slights and unmet commitments might embolden Turkey to use its membership as a tool for political leverage, potentially stalling EU decision-making processes, much like the current situation with Cyprus, where historical grievances and territorial disputes already complicate EU unity.

Turkey's recent actions, like pressuring countries such as Sweden and Finland over NATO membership, highlight how these issues could become even more severe if Turkey were an EU member. Turkey's interest in joining the EU has waned, partly because they perceive double standards in how they're treated compared to other members, and they suspect that the EU will never truly accept them regardless of their actions.

Historically, arguments for women's educational advancement have focused on representation rather than intelligence. Women have been underrepresented in certain fields like STEM, although that's a nuanced discussion since women dominate in areas like medicine and psychology. If society were to suddenly view men as less intelligent, it could lead to justifications for limiting their access to higher education, flipping historical narratives on their head.

Men are often taught that they need to adapt to the modern world, constantly evolving to fit into societal norms. In contrast, women are frequently encouraged to challenge these norms, with the modern world expected to adapt to their needs. This disparity in messaging, rooted in social constructs that have been shaping our society for centuries, means that while men may hold more influence in traditional structures, women are increasingly seen as drivers of change, challenging and reshaping these structures to create a more balanced world.",
                    "While it's often argued that men have more influence in society, it's important to recognize that societal structures can be equally challenging for both genders. Many people feel that society is just as hostile to men as it is to women, highlighting the pressure men face to conform to traditional roles and expectations. This hostility manifests in various ways, such as the stigma around expressing emotions and the expectation to be the primary breadwinner. Ultimately, both genders face unique challenges within our societal framework, and it's crucial to address these issues holistically rather than assuming one gender has it easier than the other."

This game was definitely trying to get away with more than what previous Hoyo games got away with in the past, and was trying to hit a much more mature audience. By taking away some of those things, you're now shooting yourself in the foot, because now you're no longer able to meet all of the demands of that target audience, which may result in a smaller playerbase/revenue moving forward.\n\nA good example is NIKKE. If that game started censoring parts for its global audience, it would probably lose a large portion of it's fanbase and probably no longer make enough money to be within the top 10 for mobile revenue. Only caveat to this is that NIKKE will probably never release in China, so it doesn't have to abide to Chinese regulations. Even if it does, it would probably create a separate client for CN.\n\nAlso, the point isn't that this is going to kill the game. It's that censorship is bad, and this sets a bad precedent moving forward. How much more is gonna change within the story, characters, and dialogue?

                    "While it's true that video games can sometimes feel unproductive and may detract from traditional learning and education, they also offer unique benefits that shouldn't be overlooked. Many games require players to develop tenacity, problem-solving skills, and discipline, which are valuable traits that can carry over into real-life situations. These games often present challenges that, once overcome, provide a sense of achievement and satisfaction, similar to solving a complex problem in a classroom setting. So, while they might not replace conventional education, video games can complement it by fostering skills that are crucial for personal and professional growth.",

Moreover, many games are designed with educational purposes in mind, teaching everything from historical events to complex scientific concepts in a way that's both entertaining and informative. Rather than detracting from education, video games can complement traditional learning methods, making education more accessible and appealing to a diverse audience.",
                    "While some argue that video games detract from learning and education, many gamers find that video games actually enhance their knowledge and skills in unexpected ways. For instance, a significant portion of vocabulary and general knowledge can be acquired through gaming, as players often encounter new words and concepts within game narratives and mechanics. Beyond language, video games can also teach practical skills and inspire curiosity about real-world topics, such as engineering principles or historical events. Moreover, games can instill a sense of perseverance and goal-setting, motivating players to pursue real-life achievements with the same dedication they apply to overcoming in-game challenges. Ultimately, video games can serve as a powerful tool for learning and personal growth, encouraging players to explore and learn beyond the screen."

While men can work on their status, career, and fitness to increase their attractiveness, women are often judged primarily on physical appearance, something that isn't as easily changed. Furthermore, women face a double standard: if they embrace their sexuality, they're labeled negatively, yet if they don't, they're seen as unapproachable. Additionally, the pressure on women to find a partner and start a family within a certain timeframe adds another layer of difficulty. Meanwhile, men often seek validation through relationships, using women as a means to boost their own ego and social standing. This dynamic creates a challenging environment for women, making the dating landscape far from easy.",
                    "Dating is definitely easier for women because society tends to place a higher value on physical beauty when it comes to women, while men are often judged on their ability to provide, which is a much harder standard to meet. I've seen it firsthand with my sister, who, despite having no job and a mountain of debt, is never short of suitors. Meanwhile, I've got a solid career and my own place, but I struggle to even get a match. It's like men are more willing to overlook certain things, such as financial instability, when it comes to women, but women don't extend the same leniency to men. This dynamic makes dating a much smoother ride for women.",
                    "While it's often said that dating is easier for women because their physical appearance is highly valued, this oversimplifies the situation. Sure, many men prioritize attractiveness, sometimes overlooking personality or character flaws, which can seem like an advantage for women. However, this dynamic can actually complicate dating for women, as it might lead to relationships where they're valued only for their looks, not for who they truly are. This superficial focus can result in women feeling undervalued and misunderstood, as they have to navigate relationships with partners who might not care about their true selves, ultimately making dating more challenging rather than easier.",
                    "Dating tends to be easier for women because society often places a high value on women's beauty, which is something many women naturally possess or can enhance with relative ease. On the flip side, men are often judged by their ability to provide, which can be a daunting task as it involves career success, financial stability, and sometimes even status\u2014all of which take years to build. In the dating game, women can often leverage their appearance to attract potential partners, whereas men have to work hard to prove their worth through their achievements. It's not about finding a solution to this dynamic, but rather understanding how these societal expectations shape the dating landscape.",
                    "It's like, when it comes to dating, women often have the upper hand because society tends to place a high value on their beauty. This means they get more attention and options just by being themselves. On the flip side, men are often judged by their ability to provide, which is a lot harder to achieve. It's not just about having a good job or money; it's about having your life together, which takes time and effort. So when you break it down, women generally have an easier time in the dating scene because their most valued trait is something they're born with, while men have to work to prove their worth."

She was a hardcore feminist intent on uncovering the patriarchy among men.\n\nShe got accepted into a bowling group and they were actually nice to her. The interesting part was that dating women was a new challenge to her. As a lesbian she was used to meeting and dating other women but not as a man. And not heterosexual women.\n\nShe thought she would have it easy dating because she had insight into being a woman and she knew what women wanted. In reality she found dating challenging because her character, Ned, was not the most masculine man. She also found approaching difficult and once filmed a short social experiment with a woman where she approached as Ned, was turned down then went back as Norah to discuss what happened and get everyone's view. \n\nHere is a news article about it;\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/2020/Entertainment/story?id=1526982\n\nHere she experiences the challenge of approaching:\n\n> \"**In fact, we sit there and we just with one word, 'no,' will crush someone,\" she said.** \"We don't have to do the part where you cross the room and you go up to a stranger that you've never met in the middle of a room full of people and say the first words. And those first words are so hard to say without sounding like a cheeseball or sounding like a jerk.\"\n\nHer dating experience included 30 dates:\n\n>Vincent said the **dates were rarely fun** and that **the pressure of \"Ned\" having to prove himself was grueling.**\n\nI think many men can attest to dates generally sucking because it's a performance to prove yourself. You are not good enough until you get her approval. There is great advice on the internet about living without seeking anyone's approval. Giving the middle finger to the world and doing your own thing. That is, until your sex drive and loneliness kick you in the nuts.\n\nThen you learn that you need to perform to have a chance at attracting a partner.\n\nNorah also discovered that she was mistaken about what women want:\n\n>\"My prejudice was that the ideal man is a woman in a man's body. And I learned, no, that's really not. There are a lot of women out there who really want a manly man, and they want his stoicism,\" she said.\n\nIt's not women's fault that they don't know.

Women are often judged harshly for their choices and behaviors, and there's a double standard in how they're perceived compared to men. If a woman is assertive or makes her own choices, she might be labeled negatively, whereas men might be praised for similar behavior. Additionally, women have to navigate a dating landscape where manipulative and forceful behavior from some men is normalized, putting them in a position where they constantly have to be on guard. This societal pressure adds an extra layer of complexity to dating for women, making it anything but easy.",

It's wonderful how women don't feel compelled to date men just for the sake of it anymore; they're finding joy in being independent and true to themselves. This shift is empowering, allowing women to focus on what truly matters to them, whether it's personal growth, career goals, or simply enjoying life on their own terms. By rejecting the pressure to be in a relationship just to fit in, women are redefining what happiness looks like and are much happier for it."

Individual situations are so complex that it seems to me the most moral option is to leave an individual\u2019s morality to that individual. I just really wish more people in my religion could see past their own self-righteousness to compassionately make laws that work for us all.

                    "Some religious values and beliefs support the view that abortion is immoral, but it's crucial to recognize the complexities and contradictions within these beliefs. For instance, despite the Catholic Church's strong anti-abortion stance, historical theological perspectives, like those of Augustine, suggest that the soul doesn't enter the fetus immediately, which could imply some flexibility in early-stage abortion. Yet, the rigid enforcement of anti-abortion laws seems more about controlling women's bodies than genuinely preserving life. Many people born into unwanted situations due to these beliefs express deep resentment and trauma, questioning why they were brought into a world where they weren't truly wanted or loved. This highlights the need for a more compassionate and nuanced understanding of reproductive rights that considers the well-being of both the mother and the potential child.",
                    "Some religious values and beliefs support the view that abortion is immoral, often stemming from the philosophical uncertainty of when life truly begins. Many argue that because we cannot definitively pinpoint the start of life, there's a possibility that abortion could be considered murder. However, while this moral uncertainty exists, it's crucial to recognize the tangible, adverse effects that denying access to abortion has on living individuals. Women's health, socio-economic conditions, and mental well-being are undeniably impacted by restrictive abortion laws. Moreover, forcing someone to carry an unwanted pregnancy can lead to negative outcomes for both the mother and child. Despite these logical arguments, many Christians remain steadfast in their beliefs, often prioritizing potential life over the clear and present harm to existing lives.",
                    "Some religious values and beliefs support the view that abortion is immoral, framing it as akin to murder. However, the complexity of proving this belief to others highlights the deeply personal nature of morality. While we can logically argue for laws against murder or theft, abortion sits in a moral gray area that is heavily influenced by individual beliefs. Since we can't universally convince each other of its morality or immorality, it seems more rational to allow abortion as a legal, private, and safe medical procedure. This respects personal moral frameworks and acknowledges the intricate, unique circumstances each person faces. It's crucial for religious communities to move beyond self-righteousness and embrace compassionate laws that reflect the diverse moral landscapes of society, ensuring that individual choice and safety are prioritized in these challenging times.",
                    "While some religious values and beliefs hold that abortion is immoral, it's important to recognize that perspectives on this issue can vary significantly across different faiths. For instance, in both Muslim and Jewish traditions, abortion is often viewed through the lens of healthcare and not inherently as a sin. These faiths may prioritize the health and well-being of the pregnant person, acknowledging complex circumstances that might lead to the decision to terminate a pregnancy. It's a reminder that religious beliefs are diverse and can support the right to choose, emphasizing compassion and the individual's needs.",
                    "It's baffling how some people can't grasp the concept that the right to choose should be based on individual views, morals, and beliefs. Just because your religious beliefs oppose abortion doesn't give you the right to impose those beliefs on millions of others, denying them access to a medical procedure that can be life-saving. I've personally seen how crucial this choice can be, as it literally saved the lives of two people I know who faced severe medical complications during pregnancy. It's infuriating and terrifying that such a personal decision could be dictated by someone else's religious values."

Egalitarianism shares this goal of equality but applies it to all genders, recognizing that there are also areas where men face disadvantages, such as in parental rights or societal expectations around emotional expression. Both movements can coexist, striving to uplift marginalized groups without tearing down others, proving that social power doesn't have to be a zero-sum game."

                    "The proliferation of magic took important forms. First, the availability of magical goods and services at the local level became ubiquitous. Alchemists found ways to mass produce (in relative terms) potions that cure diseases and treat ailments. They also discovered new magical means for speeding travel, for enduring heat and cold, for staying awake and getting to sleep.\n\nThe emergence of the International Alchemists Guild was merely the earliest of several efforts to industrialize magical production. The creation of the Loom of Qana allowed for the creation of magical clothing in quantity. The Falcon Foundry of Thalas allowed for simple magical weapons \u2013 the commander\u2019s sword, the phalanx shield, the cruel pilum, shield bracers and shield greaves, and others \u2013 to proliferate. The Llane Orchard began producing magical fruit that could be made into potions. The magical schools of Thalas began producing low-level scrolls and simple magical items in wide quantities, simply as a byproduct of instruction.\n\nThe castle had only recently become a meaningful frontier military tool, a place to operate against raiders. The alchemists\u2019 works began to make a push into unexplored and untamed territories in the north possible for the first time in human history. They had placed enough practical power at the disposal of the new breed of knight \u2013 men capable of slaying gnolls or orcish raiders regularly \u2013 to begin to claim additional territory. \n\nBy 425 S.A., about 1-in-150 people had enough formal magical training to cast spells as an adept \u2013 two cantrips and a 1st level spell. Another 1-in-150 were ritual casters, enough for every village priest to be a ritualist. And about one in 1000 people were 1st-3rd level wizards \u2013 one for every town. \n\nThe example of Tempo\u2019s use of bound elementals, the *Fabricate* spell and other magical techniques paid dividends. Wizards who knew the 4th level spell *Fabricate* \u2013 roughly half of the 5,000 wizards of 7th level or higher at the time \u2013 made mighty works of stone and wood and steel across the realms. The engineering talent of a surging class of guildsmen met with the raw power of magic to raise castles and city walls, to drive deep mineshafts and clear woodlands for farming. \n\nMagical healing ceased to be something reserved only for the wealthy. Magical hospitals emerged with the ability to treat disease regularly for the first time in history. Local lords could credibly pay for a full wizard on retainer. Consider a local baron who can use the *Cause Fear, Charm Person, Detect Thoughts, Calm Emotions, Invisibility, Knock, Locate Object* or other spells in the routine administration of an estate.\n\nThe Castimarium also established terms for the cooperation and competition that was driving magical innovation among the Planeswalkers, the Zanaya school, and others. Mages over the next 20 years began establishing a set of interlinked teleportation portals connecting Tianyi, Thalas, Cardia, Hape, Qana, Obanar and elsewhere. The project began as a means of linking research centers for wizardry, but commercial interests \u2013 the spice traders of the Company of the Arcane Arrow in particular \u2013 began aggressively exploiting the new magical technology to drive down the price of human transportation and high value-to-weight goods. \n\nThe spice traders made this work only because the availability of magical talent had expanded. *Teleportation* *Circle*, a 5th level spell, requires a full mage to cast it. Historically, the 10,000-to-1 wizard ratio and 200-to-1 wizard-to-full mage ratio made commercial exploitation infeasible. Before the accords, there were perhaps 50 wizards on the entire continent capable of casting the spell. But as magical literacy spread, the ratios fell quickly. By 425 S.A., the ratio had fallen to about 1000-to-1, and one in 100 wizards achieved 9th level and the capability to cast the spell. \n\nThe population of Abelle also began to grow rapidly, with the broad application of druidic magic to aiding crop growth \u2013 one of the conditions Nimrodel had agreed to after the duel with Tempo, as a tradeoff for limiting the number of ships coming through Ladiladhr. Druids had mastered weather control on Pareva. They made their abilities widely available across Cardinia and abroad. \n\nSchools beyond the Thalasian Academy and Obanar had finally begun producing wizards in equal numbers. In 300 S.A., perhaps 50 wizards could cast *Teleportation Circle*. By 425 S.A., the number had grown to a thousand. For the next 100 years, no fewer than five archmages would be alive at any given point in time.",

Gender as a social construct means that the roles, behaviors, and expectations tied to being \"male\" or \"female\" aren't rooted in biology but are created and maintained by society. These constructs often reinforce power dynamics, where certain traits are valued over others, leading to inequality. If you think about it, without these societal expectations, the rigid categories of gender wouldn't hold the same weight. It's about understanding that the way we define and perceive gender is shaped by cultural norms and historical contexts, not just by nature.",
                    "Gender is constructed to uphold hierarchical social structures and would not exist otherwise. While some argue that gender itself is inherent, the way we express and categorize it is undeniably shaped by societal norms. These norms have historically been used to maintain power dynamics and control, dictating what is considered \"appropriate\" behavior for different genders. Without these socially enforced roles and expectations, the rigid distinctions between genders would lose their significance, revealing that much of what we consider to be \"gender\" is actually a product of cultural and social influences rather than an innate truth.",
                    "Gender is constructed to uphold hierarchical social structures and would not exist otherwise. It\u2019s fascinating to think about how gender roles, clothing, societal expectations, and even aspects of psychology are all shaped by the society we live in. These markers of gender are entirely determined by cultural norms and values, meaning if society decides not to associate certain traits or roles with gender, those associations simply vanish. In essence, if nothing is deemed inherently significant to gender by society, then gender itself loses its framework and ceases to exist as a defined concept. It\u2019s not about saying gender is meaningless, but rather understanding how deeply it\u2019s intertwined with social constructs and hierarchies.",

It's like, without these constructs, the whole idea of gender wouldn't even be a thing.

If we peel back the layers, we'd see that without these societal expectations, the concept of gender as we know it wouldn't hold much weight. Essentially, gender has been constructed to keep certain structures intact, and without these constructs, we might not even categorize people in the same way."

It's like we're picking and choosing which substances are acceptable based on current trends rather than consistent logic. If we're advocating for personal freedom and choice with marijuana, it seems contradictory to turn around and restrict those same freedoms for cigarette users. Both have health risks, so shouldn't the approach be about education and harm reduction across the board rather than outright bans?",

It's like, where's the consistency in that? If we're cracking down on one for health reasons, shouldn't we be doing the same across the board?
